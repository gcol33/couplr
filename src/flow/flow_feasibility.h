// src/flow/flow_feasibility.h
// Reaching a feasible restricted master, and knowing when there is none.
// Pure C++ - NO Rcpp dependencies, same rule as lap_types.h.
//
// Pricing to optimality and reaching feasibility are different tasks. The pricer
// wants the pairs a dual solution would have used; a master that came back short
// of the required flow has no such solution to price with, and the answer it
// needs is which rows could not be matched at all. Doubling a candidate width
// until the shortfall goes away answers that by exhausting a ladder, and reports
// genuine infeasibility only by running out of rungs.
//
// Hall's condition is the answer instead. A row-perfect matching over the
// restricted arc set exists exactly when every row set S reaches |S| distinct
// columns, and lap_hall.h returns the S that fails together with N(S), by
// Hopcroft-Karp and the Koenig alternating-reachability cut. One round is:
//
//   1. Match over the *restricted* graph -- the candidate pairs the cost source
//      admits. Row-perfect, and this block is feasible.
//   2. Otherwise S and N(S) come back. Re-seed those rows, and only those: a row
//      that is already matched does not pay for a row that is not.
//   3. The re-seed reads the *full* source over the deficient rows. When it
//      finds no admissible column outside N(S), N(S) is the whole neighbourhood
//      of S in the complete implicit problem, |S| > |N(S)| holds there too, and
//      the answer is infeasible with a certificate rather than a wider ladder.
//
// Step 3 is O(|S| * ncol), which is affordable exactly when the deficient set is
// small, and a problem where it is not small is not one edge generation should
// be running.
//
// **The re-seed takes columns outside N(S) only.** Every restricted edge out of
// S lands inside N(S) -- that is what makes (S, N(S)) a witness -- so a matching
// of S is bounded by |N(S)| however many arcs into N(S) are added. Arcs into
// N(S) are the pricer's business, arcs out of it are the only ones that move the
// deficiency, and a re-seed that could not tell them apart would spend rounds
// adding pairs that cannot repair anything.
//
// Scope is the assignment block: rows carrying one unit each, which is the
// question Hall's condition and Hopcroft-Karp answer. A block whose rows demand
// several units -- a ratio match, a full match -- fails feasibility under a
// different condition and is not this header's.
