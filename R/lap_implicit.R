# ==============================================================================
# Edge generation: the assignment over a complete implicit graph
# ==============================================================================
# The problem is stated over every pair and solved over a fraction of them. A
# restricted master is solved, its potentials are read as assignment duals, the
# pairs it omits are priced against them, the ones pricing below zero are added,
# and the master is re-solved from where it stopped. When nothing prices below
# zero the duals are feasible for every pair of the complete problem and the
# restricted answer is optimal for all of them. That last step is what separates
# this from approximate k-nearest matching, which solves the same restricted
# master and stops.
#
# The loop itself is C++ (src/flow/flow_implicit.h): it owns the compiled
# problem, the candidate set and the cost source, and crosses to R once rather
# than once per round. This file is the R surface -- the orientation the loop is
# handed, the answer read back in the caller's units, and the certificate and
# the search record put where a caller finds them.
#
# `certify` defaults to TRUE here and to FALSE everywhere else, and that is the
# one place a default differs across paths. On a complete solve a certificate is
# extra work over an answer already known to be optimal; here it is the only
# thing that distinguishes the answer from an approximate one, so an uncertified
# implicit solve is not something to hand back by default.
# ==============================================================================

# The search knobs, in one place, so the loop's C++ defaults and R's cannot
# drift apart in what they mean:
#
#   keep_per_row  violators a row contributes per pricing round
#   width         columns the first feasibility round gives a deficient row
#   tol           a pair prices out at cbar < -tol
#   max_rounds    guard, not a convergence bound
#
# They are not arguments of assignment() or match_couples(). The loop converges
# on any of them and none has a measured rule behind it yet, so they stay
# reachable for the harnesses that measure them and off the front doors until
# one does.
