// src/flow/flow_solve.cpp
// Successive shortest paths with Johnson potentials, over a residual graph.
// Pure C++ - NO Rcpp dependencies, same rule as lap_types.h.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Lower bounds are the solver's job
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The problem as posed is a bounded-variable transshipment:
//
//     min  sum_a cost(a) * f(a)
//     s.t. sum_{a out of v} f(a) - sum_{a into v} f(a) = supply(v)
//          lower(a) <= f(a) <= upper(a)
//
// Substituting f(a) = lower(a) + g(a) moves the lower bounds off the variables
// and into the node balances. The capacity constraint becomes
// 0 <= g(a) <= upper(a) - lower(a), and conservation at v becomes
//
//     sum_out g - sum_in g = supply(v) - sum_out lower + sum_in lower =: d(v)
//
// so the mandatory flow every lower bound forces is charged to the two nodes it
// runs between: the tail loses that much of its ability to supply, the head
// gains that much of an obligation to dispose. The objective shifts by the
// constant sum_a cost(a) * lower(a), which is why the total cost is summed from
// f = lower + g at the end rather than accumulated per augmentation.
//
// The residual d(v) is a b-flow: some nodes carry an excess to place and others
// a deficit to fill. Because sum_v supply(v) = 0 and every lower bound
// contributes -lower at its tail and +lower at its head, sum_v d(v) = 0, so the
// two sides balance and the excess side sums to flow_required.
//
// Successive shortest paths moves that b-flow one path at a time: take a node s
// with d(s) > 0, find a shortest residual path from it to any node t with
// d(t) < 0, and push what the two balances and the path allow. A feasible g
// exists exactly when every excess can be delivered, so "a lower bound cannot be
// met" is not a separate condition to test; it is the shortfall that leaves
// flow_sent below flow_required, and the status distinguishes the two by how
// much was placed.
//
// The search starts at one excess node rather than at a super-source over all of
// them. A super-source settles every excess node at distance zero and therefore
// relaxes the whole arc set on every augmentation, which costs one pass over the
// arcs per unit of flow whatever the arc set holds. A single source reaches only
// the alternating tree that one node can grow.
//
// A source that reaches no deficit node is blocked for good, which is what lets
// the loop skip it and still place a maximum flow. Every arc leaving its
// reachable set R(s) is saturated, and a later path from another source that
// entered R(s) would have to leave it again to finish, so nothing that happens
// afterwards changes what s can reach.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Reduced costs and the search
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//     cbar(a) = cost(a) + pi[tail(a)] - pi[head(a)]
//
// Successive shortest paths keeps the invariant cbar(a) >= 0 on every residual
// arc. A search that stops at the first deficit node t restores it by adding
// min(dist[v], dist[t]) to every potential. An arc between two nodes at or past
// dist[t] is left alone; an arc out of a node settled before t is covered by the
// relaxation that gave its head a label; an arc into a node settled before t
// gains dist[t] - dist[v] > 0. The arcs on the augmenting path come out at
// cbar == 0.
//
// That clamp is also why the invariant has to hold before the first search
// rather than from the first update onwards: an arc between two nodes the search
// never reached keeps whatever cbar it had. So a cold start computes potentials
// that give it. Relaxing pi[head] against pi[tail] + cost over the arc set until
// nothing moves is the shortest distance from a virtual root joined to every
// node at zero, which is the invariant written out; with every cost non-negative
// the first pass changes nothing and leaves pi == 0, and no arc set can keep
// moving for more than n_nodes passes unless it prices some cycle below zero.
//
// The search is then plain Dijkstra: with cbar >= 0 a settled node is final, so
// the first deficit node to reach the top of the queue is the nearest one and
// the search stops there rather than draining the queue. The two directions of
// one arc are priced by expressions that are negatives of each other in exact
// arithmetic and not in floating point, so both can round a few ulps below zero
// at once. Where the invariant says the price cannot be negative, rounding is
// the only thing that could have made it so, and it is read as rounding.
