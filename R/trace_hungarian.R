# Reference Hungarian (shortest augmenting path) with frame-by-frame trace
# ==============================================================================
# This is the *teaching* implementation: a slow, readable R version of the
# Kuhn-Munkres primal-dual algorithm in its modern shortest-augmenting-path
# formulation. The production solver lives in C++ and is reached via
# assignment(cost, method = "hungarian"); this one exists purely to emit a
# step-by-step state trace for lap_animate().
#
# Algorithmic outline (for square cost matrices, nrow(cost) == ncol(cost)):
#
#   1. Initialise duals u, v so that c[i,j] - u[i] - v[j] >= 0 for all (i,j).
#      (Row mins for u, then column mins of c - u for v.)
#   2. For each row k = 1..n:
#      a. Grow a shortest-path tree rooted at row k on the residual graph
#         where the edge cost is the reduced cost c[i,j] - u[i] - v[j].
#         Cols are reached via outgoing edges from rows; rows are reached
#         via the incoming matched edge of a reached col.
#      b. When a free column is popped from the priority queue, the shortest
#         augmenting path has been found.
#      c. Update duals: scanned cols j get v[j] += dist[j] - delta; scanned
#         rows i get u[i] += delta - row_dist[i]. This keeps matched edges
#         tight and exposes the new path edges as tight.
#      d. Flip the matching along the alternating path.
#   3. After n iterations every row is matched.
#
# A frame is emitted at each pedagogically meaningful moment:
#   init / select_row / scan / path / dual_update / augment / final.
