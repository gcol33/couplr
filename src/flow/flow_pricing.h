// src/flow/flow_pricing.h
// Block pricing: which omitted pairs a restricted master would want.
// Pure C++ - NO Rcpp dependencies, same rule as lap_types.h.
//
// A restricted master solves over the candidate set and returns duals. Those
// duals price every pair the master did not hold: cbar_ij = c_ij - u_i - v_j,
// and a pair with cbar_ij < -tol is one the master would have used had it been
// offered. When no omitted pair prices below -tol the duals are feasible for
// the complete implicit problem and the restricted answer is optimal for it.
//
// Two things are asked of one pass, and both are answered here:
//
//   - the minimum reduced cost over the omitted pairs, which is the
//     termination test;
//   - the `keep_per_row` most negative per row, which is what the next round
//     adds to the candidate set.
//
// Only omitted pairs are priced. A candidate pair that became an arc is priced
// at or above zero by the master's own optimality, and a candidate pair the
// source forbids is not admissible at all, so neither can be the violator this
// is looking for.
//
// This is the pricer that works for every cost source. It is O(nrow * ncol)
// arithmetic and makes no assumption about the cost function beyond the source
// concept, which is what makes it both the fallback for metrics no bound can
// prune and the reference every pruned result is asserted against.
//
// It templates on the concrete source rather than reaching through CostOracle.
// The master pays one virtual call per arc at expansion time and can afford it;
// this loop runs over every omitted pair and cannot.
//
// The scan is row-outer and stores nothing: the source is read one pair at a
// time and the reduced cost is consumed on the spot. Column blocking, which
// would read a block of `v` and of the source's column data once per block
// rather than once per row, was written against this order and measured at
// five widths on four shapes by dev_notes/phase3/c4_timing.cpp. It is worth
// nothing on any of them, to the millisecond, because both arrays are walked
// in order and the prefetcher already covers them while the distance
// arithmetic dominates.
