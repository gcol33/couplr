\title{k-best linear assignment solutions (Murty's algorithm)}
\usage{
kbest_assignment(
  cost,
  k = 3,
  maximize = FALSE,
  method = c("murty"),
  single_method = c("jv")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost}{Numeric cost matrix where rows represent sources and columns represent
targets. Use \code{NA} or \code{Inf} for forbidden assignments.}

\item{k}{Integer; the number of best distinct solutions to return.}

\item{maximize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, maximizes total cost instead of minimizing.}

\item{method}{Character string indicating which k-best algorithm to use.
Currently only \code{"murty"} is implemented (reserved for future variants).}

\item{single_method}{Character string giving the base assignment solver
used within each Murty node. Typically \code{"jv"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per assignment in each solution and columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{rank} – rank of the solution (1 = best),
\item \code{match_id} – identifier for the solution (same as rank),
\item \code{row}, \code{col} – assigned row and column indices,
\item \code{cost_edge} – cost of the assignment edge,
\item \code{cost_total} – total cost of the full solution.
}
}
\description{
Compute the top-\eqn{k} optimal solutions to the linear assignment problem
using Murty's algorithm. Each solution represents a distinct assignment
of rows to columns with its total cost.
}
\details{
Murty’s algorithm systematically partitions the solution space of the
assignment problem to find the next-best solutions after the optimal one.
Each subproblem is solved with a base LAP solver (\code{single_method}).

cost <- matrix(c(

  3, 3, 6,
  7, 5, 4
