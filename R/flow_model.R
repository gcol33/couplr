# ==============================================================================
# The flow model
# ==============================================================================
# Every matching design is the same object underneath: nodes carrying supplies,
# and arcs carrying a cost and a capacity range. A one-to-one match, a k:1
# match and a full match differ in which bounds their arcs get, not in which
# code runs.
#
# What lives here is the R side of that object, and it is a description rather
# than an engine. Compiling a design, solving it, and checking the answer stay
# three separate steps because the third one is only worth anything while it is
# separate: a solver that hands back its own verdict has proven nothing. The
# flow and the potentials go into verify_flow() as inputs to a check, exactly
# as the assignment duals go into verify_assignment(), and potentials that
# certify nothing make the check fail rather than pass.
#
# Node ids are 1-based here and 0-based in the C++ model. Capacities cross as
# doubles with Inf standing for the model's unbounded capacity, because R has
# no 64-bit integer type and every finite capacity a design produces is a unit
# count well inside the range a double holds exactly.

#' Verify that a flow is optimal
#'
#' Checks a flow and a set of node potentials against the linear-programming
#' optimality conditions for the minimum-cost flow problem, and returns the
#' result of each check. Unlike the `status` field on a solve result, which
#' records what the solver terminated on, this is a proof: `certified_optimal`
#' is `TRUE` only when every condition holds.
#'
#' The problem is
#'
#' \preformatted{
#'   min  sum_a cost(a) f(a)
#'   s.t. (flow out of v) - (flow into v) = supply(v)   at every node v
#'        lower(a) <= f(a) <= upper(a)                  on every arc a
#' }
#'
#' and, writing `cbar(a) = cost(a) + pi(tail(a)) - pi(head(a))` for the reduced
#' cost under the potentials `pi`, the conditions checked are primal
#' feasibility, `cbar(a) >= -tol` on every arc that can still take flow, and
#' `cbar(a) <= tol` on every arc carrying more than its lower bound. Their
#' objective form is checked too: the duality gap is the sum of the slackness
#' violations weighted by `|cbar|`, so it is where a violation too small to
#' trip the per-arc tolerance still accumulates.
#'
#' The check needs potentials. If `x` carries them, as a solve result does,
#' they are used. Otherwise they are obtained by solving `problem`, which costs
#' a second solve. Either way they are verified, not trusted: an arc priced
#' below the tolerance makes the verification fail rather than pass.
#'
#' Optimal potentials are shared by all optimal solutions of a linear program,
#' so a flow from one solver can be certified against potentials from another.
#'
#' @param x A `flow_solve_result`, or a numeric vector giving the flow on each
#'   arc in the order the arcs are listed.
#' @param problem The flow problem the flow belongs to: a `couplr_flow_problem`
#'   or a list with elements `n_nodes`, `supply` and `arcs`, where `arcs` is a
#'   data frame with columns `tail`, `head`, `lower`, `upper` and `cost` and
#'   node ids run from 1. Required unless `x` already carries one.
#' @param potential Optional numeric vector of node potentials, one per node.
#'   Overrides any potentials on `x`.
#' @param tol Numeric tolerance for the feasibility and slackness comparisons.
#'   The duality-gap comparison scales this by the magnitude of the objective,
#'   since an absolute tolerance on a sum of many terms is not reachable in
#'   double precision.
#'
#' @return An object of class `flow_certificate`, a list with elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `certified_optimal` - logical, the conclusion. `TRUE` only when
#'         every condition below holds.
#'   \item `primal_feasible` - logical; every arc inside its bounds and every
#'         node's net flow equal to its supply.
#'   \item `n_capacity_violations`, `n_conservation_violations`,
#'         `max_conservation_error` - what primal feasibility failed on.
#'   \item `dual_feasible` - logical; no arc that can still take flow prices
#'         below `-tol`.
#'   \item `complementary_slackness` - logical; no arc above its lower bound
#'         prices above `tol`.
#'   \item `n_cs_violations`, `min_residual_reduced_cost`, `worst_arc` - the
#'         smallest reduced cost over the residual graph and the arc attaining
#'         it, which is a violation when it falls below `-tol`. `worst_arc` is
#'         0 when no arc can either take or give up flow.
#'   \item `primal_objective`, `dual_objective`, `duality_gap` - numeric.
