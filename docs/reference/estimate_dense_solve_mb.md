# Estimate the peak footprint of a dense solve in megabytes

The matrix is the allocation a caller can reason about and it is not
what bounds a dense solve. Preparation copies, the solver's own
workspace and the assignment structures it carries all sit on top of the
matrix, and the peak is what decides whether the solve fits, so that is
the quantity the guard compares against available RAM.

## Usage

``` r
estimate_dense_solve_mb(n, m, solve_factor = 12)
```

## Arguments

- n, m:

  Problem dimensions.

- solve_factor:

  Multiplier on the raw cell bytes.

## Value

Numeric scalar, the estimated peak footprint of a dense solve in
megabytes.

## Details

The multiplier is read off the measurement rather than from an
enumeration of the copies, which has proved to understate it. On the
memory benchmark – one fresh R session per arm, peak resident set taken
from outside and read against an idle session that loaded the same
packages – a dense one-to-one solve has peaked at between 7 and 11 times
the raw matrix bytes from 5,000 to 20,000 units, with the figure at a
given size moving between runs. The default of 12 sits above every
measured peak, which is the direction a guard should err in: it exists
to refuse a solve that will not fit, not to predict where the peak
lands.

## Examples

``` r
estimate_dense_solve_mb(5000, 5000)
```
