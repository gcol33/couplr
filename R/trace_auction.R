# ==============================================================================
# Reference forward auction (Bertsekas 1988) with frame-by-frame trace
# ==============================================================================
# Teaching implementation. The production solver lives in C++ and is reached
# via assignment(cost, method = "auction"); this R version exists purely to
# emit a step-by-step state trace for lap_animate().
#
# Algorithmic outline (minimization, square cost matrix):
#
#   1. Treat as a maximization of v[i,j] := -c[i,j] (or +c if maximize=TRUE).
#      Each object j carries a price p[j], initially 0. A person i's "net
#      profit" from object j is a[i,j] := v[i,j] - p[j].
#   2. While any person is unassigned:
#      a. Pick an unassigned person i.
#      b. Identify their best object j* = argmax_j a[i,j] (profit v_best)
#         and second-best (profit w_best).
#      c. Person i bids on j*, raising its price by
#                p[j*] += (v_best - w_best) + eps.
#         The margin (v_best - w_best) is the smallest amount that, at the new
#         price, leaves i indifferent between j* and their next favourite; the
#         +eps ensures strict progress.
#      d. If j* was held by some person k, k is displaced (becomes unassigned).
#         Then i is assigned to j*.
#   3. The fixed eps is chosen small enough that an eps-equilibrium implies
#      an exactly optimal assignment. For integer costs eps < 1/n is sufficient;
#      for real-valued costs we pick eps proportional to the cost scale.
