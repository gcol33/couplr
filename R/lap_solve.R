# For most users, prefer the tidy interface lap_solve() below.
# ==============================================================================
#' Linear assignment solver
#'
#' Solve the linear assignment problem (minimum- or maximum-cost matching)
#' using several algorithms. Forbidden edges can be marked as `NA` or `Inf`.
#'
#' @param cost Numeric matrix; rows = tasks, columns = agents. `NA` or `Inf`
#'   entries are treated as forbidden assignments.
#' @param maximize Logical; if `TRUE`, maximizes the total cost instead of minimizing.
#' @param method Character string indicating the algorithm to use. Options:
#'
#'   **General-purpose solvers:**
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `"auto"` — Automatic selection based on problem characteristics (default)
#'     \item `"jv"` — 'Jonker-Volgenant', fast general-purpose O(n^3) with warm-start
#'     \item `"hungarian"` — Classic 'Hungarian' (shortest augmenting path) O(n^3)
#'     \item `"munkres"` — Matrix-form 'Kuhn-Munkres' O(n^4), reference implementation
#'   }
#'
#'   **Auction-based solvers:**
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `"auction"` — 'Bertsekas' auction with adaptive epsilon
#'     \item `"auction_gs"` — 'Gauss-Seidel' variant, good for spatial structure
#'     \item `"auction_scaled"` — 'Epsilon-scaling', fastest for large dense problems
#'   }
#'
#'   **Specialized solvers:**
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `"sap"` — Shortest augmenting path over the shared flow model,
#'       handles sparsity well. `"ssp"` is accepted as a second spelling of this
#'       method and resolves to `"sap"`.
#'     \item `"sap_dense"` — Shortest augmenting path with a linear scan in place
#'       of a heap, O(n * m^2), suited to a dense cost matrix
#'     \item `"lapmod"` — Sparse JV variant, faster when >50\% entries are NA/Inf
#'     \item `"hk01"` — 'Hopcroft-Karp' for binary (0/1) or constant costs.
#'       Constant costs make every perfect matching optimal. On a `{0,1}` matrix
#'       the search runs over the zero-cost edges alone, where a perfect matching
#'       totals zero and is therefore optimal; if none exists the problem is
#'       passed to the weighted solver on the original costs.
#'     \item `"ssap_bucket"` — 'Dial' algorithm for integer costs
#'     \item `"bruteforce"` — Exact enumeration for tiny problems (n <= 8)
#'   }
#'
#'   **Advanced solvers:**
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `"csa"` — 'Goldberg-Kennedy' cost-scaling, often fastest for medium-large
#'     \item `"gabow_tarjan"` — 'Gabow-Tarjan' bit-scaling with complementary
#'       slackness. On a graph of `V` vertices and `E` edges the bound is
#'       O(sqrt(V) * E * log(V * C)), which for an `n` by `n` cost matrix is
#'       O(n^2.5 * log(n * C)). Its optimality bound holds for a matching that
#'       saturates both sides, so a rectangular problem gains a dummy side of
#'       zero cost. The dummies are copies of one node and are carried as a
#'       single unit holding as many partners as there are dummies, so the
#'       problem is solved at its own `n` by `m` shape.
#'     \item `"cycle_cancel"` — Cycle-canceling with 'Karp' algorithm
#'     \item `"csflow"` — Successive shortest paths with 'Johnson' potentials
#'     \item `"network_simplex"` — 'Network simplex' with spanning tree representation
#'     \item `"push_relabel"` — 'Goldberg-Tarjan' cost-scaling push-relabel
#'     \item `"ramshaw_tarjan"` — 'Ramshaw-Tarjan', optimized for rectangular matrices (n != m)
#'   }
#'
#'   One-dimensional problems have their own entry point,
#'   [lap_solve_line_metric()], which takes two point vectors rather than a
#'   cost matrix and runs in O(n log n).
#'
#'   Under `"auto"`, a single pass over `cost` supplies the facts the following
#'   rules need, and the first matching rule wins:
#'   \enumerate{
#'     \item at most 8 rows and 8 columns: `"bruteforce"`, exact and faster
#'       than setting up a general solver;
#'     \item finite entries all equal, or all either 0 or 1: `"hk01"`, which
#'       exploits the absence of a real cost scale;
#'     \item more than half the entries non-finite: `"lapmod"`, which carries
#'       forbidden edges in its adjacency structure;
#'     \item at least 3 times as many columns as rows: `"sap"`, avoiding the
#'       padding a square-oriented solver would need;
#'     \item everything else: `"jv"`.
#'   }
#'   Naming a method skips the pass. Rectangular problems are transposed
#'   internally so the solver always sees at least as many columns as rows, and
#'   the assignment is mapped back afterwards.
#' @param auction_eps Optional numeric epsilon for the 'Auction'/'Auction-GS' methods.
#'   If `NULL`, an internal default (e.g., `1e-9`) is used.
#' @param eps Deprecated. Use `auction_eps`. If provided and `auction_eps` is `NULL`,
#'   its value is used for `auction_eps`.
#' @param memory_mode One of "auto" (default), "dense", "lazy" or "implicit".
#'   `cost` is already a materialized matrix by the time it reaches
#'   `assignment()`, so "auto" here is diagnostic only: it warns if the matrix
#'   is large relative to free system RAM (nothing else can be done post-hoc
#'   once the matrix already exists -- build it via
#'   `compute_distances(memory_mode = ...)` instead to avoid materializing it in
#'   the first place). `"lazy"` and `"implicit"` describe how a cost source is
#'   read rather than how a matrix is stored, so they apply to a lazy cost
#'   specification; `"implicit"` also accepts a matrix, where it solves the same
#'   problem by generating the pairs it needs and saves nothing, which is what
#'   makes it a check on the complete solve rather than a faster one.
#'   `"implicit"` is slower than `"lazy"` on every shape measured so far, and
#'   the time goes to the restricted solve rather than to the pair scan, so what
#'   it buys today is the certificate over the complete problem.
#' @param certify Logical; whether to attach a checked `assignment_certificate`
#'   as `certificate`. `NULL`, the default, takes the path's own answer: `TRUE`
#'   under `memory_mode = "implicit"`, where the certificate is what
#'   distinguishes the answer from an approximate one and the loop has already
#'   done most of the scan, and `FALSE` elsewhere, where the duals are not among
#'   the things the solve returns and the check costs the solve
#'   [verify_assignment()] runs to get them. A solve that did not reach a
#'   complete optimal matching has nothing to certify and gets no certificate.
#' @param cardinality How many pairs to produce.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `"complete"` (default) — every row is matched; an input admitting
#'       no complete matching is an error.
#'     \item `"maximum"` — as many pairs as the admissible edges allow, and the
#'       cheapest total among matchings of that size.
#'     \item `"fixed"` — exactly `n_matches` pairs, chosen to minimize total
#'       cost.
#'   }
#'   All three are solved exactly by the same solver: the two non-complete modes
#'   append dummy columns priced so that the solver's own optimum is the
#'   requested objective.
#' @param n_matches Integer; the number of pairs to produce. Required when
#'   `cardinality = "fixed"`, and not accepted otherwise.
#' @param unmatched_penalty Numeric; the cost charged for leaving one row
#'   unmatched, under `cardinality = "maximum"`. Supplying it replaces the
#'   lexicographic objective with a single one: a pair costing more than the
#'   penalty is worth dropping. Left `NULL`, no pair is ever traded away for a
#'   cost saving.
#'
#' @return An object of class `lap_solve_result`, a list with elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `match` — integer vector of length `min(nrow(cost), ncol(cost))`
#'         giving the assigned column for each row (0 if unassigned).
#'   \item `total_cost` — numeric scalar, the objective value.
#'   \item `status` — character scalar drawn from [solver_status_values()],
#'         computed from what the solver terminated on. `"optimal"` means the
#'         solver reached its own optimality condition with every row matched;
#'         it is not a checked proof. Use [verify_assignment()] for that.
#'   \item `method_used` — character scalar, the algorithm actually used.
#'   \item `dispatch` — list recording how `method` was chosen: the rule that
#'         fired under `"auto"`, the condition that triggered it, and whether
#'         the method was named explicitly. See [explain_dispatch()].
#'   \item `certificate` — an `assignment_certificate`, present when one was
#'         checked. See `certify`.
#' }
#' Under `memory_mode = "implicit"` the result also carries `u` and `v`, the
#' duals the last restricted master produced, and `search`: the columns the
#' first round gave each row (`seed_width`), the pairs the candidate set ended
#' up holding (`candidate_edges`) out of `possible_edges`, the pairs a cost was
#' computed for (`edges_evaluated`), the round count, and `rounds`, one row per
#' round of what the master held, what priced out and what each step cost.
#'
#' @details
#' `method = "auto"` selects an algorithm based on problem size/shape and data
#' characteristics:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Very small (n <= 8 and m <= 8): `"bruteforce"` — exact enumeration
#'   \item Binary/constant costs: `"hk01"` — specialized for 0/1 costs
#'   \item Sparse (>50\% NA/Inf): `"lapmod"` — sparse JV variant, at every size
#'   \item Very rectangular (m >= 3n): `"sap"` — handles rectangular well
#'   \item Otherwise: `"jv"` — fastest general-purpose solver at every size
#' }
#' The other solvers are available by naming them explicitly.

#' Solve linear assignment problems
#'
#' Provides a tidy interface for solving the linear assignment problem using
#' 'Hungarian' or 'Jonker-Volgenant' algorithms. Supports rectangular matrices,
#' NA/Inf masking, and data frame inputs.
#'
#' @param x Cost matrix, data frame, or tibble. If a data frame/tibble,
#'   must include columns specified by `source`, `target`, and `cost`.
#' @param source Column name for source/row indices (if `x` is a data frame)
#' @param target Column name for target/column indices (if `x` is a data frame)
#' @param cost Column name for costs (if `x` is a data frame)
#' @param maximize Logical; if TRUE, maximizes total cost instead of minimizing (default: FALSE)
#' @param method Algorithm to use. One of:
#'   - "auto" (default): automatically selects best algorithm
#'   - "jv": 'Jonker-Volgenant' algorithm (general purpose, fast)
#'   - "hungarian": Classic 'Hungarian' algorithm
#'   - "auction": 'Bertsekas' auction algorithm (good for large dense problems)
#'   - "sap": Sparse assignment (good for sparse/rectangular problems)
#'   - "hk01": 'Hopcroft-Karp' for binary/uniform costs
#' @param forbidden Value to mark forbidden assignments (default: NA). Can also use Inf.
#'
#' @return A tibble with columns:
#'   - `source`: row/source indices
#'   - `target`: column/target indices  
#'   - `cost`: cost of each assignment
#'   - `total_cost`: total cost (attribute)

# Specialized 1-D Line-Metric LAP Solver
# ============================================================================

#' Solve 1-D Line Assignment Problem
#'
#' Solves the linear assignment problem when both sources and targets are 
#' ordered points on a line. Uses efficient O(n*m) dynamic programming
#' for rectangular problems and O(n) sorting for square problems.
#'
#' This is a specialized solver that exploits the structure of 1-dimensional
#' assignment problems where costs depend only on the distance between points
#' on a line. It is much faster than general LAP solvers for this special case.
#'
#' @param x Numeric vector of source positions (will be sorted internally)
#' @param y Numeric vector of target positions (will be sorted internally)
#' @param cost Cost function for distance. Either:
#'   - "L1" (default): absolute distance ('Manhattan' distance)
#'   - "L2": squared distance (squared 'Euclidean' distance)
#'   Can also use aliases: "abs", "manhattan" for L1; "sq", "squared", "quadratic" for L2
#' @param maximize Logical; if TRUE, maximizes total cost instead of minimizing (default: FALSE)
#'
#' @details
#' The algorithm works as follows:
#' 
#' **Square case (n == m):**
#' Both vectors are sorted and matched in order: \code{x[1] -> y[1]}, \code{x[2] -> y[2]}, etc.
#' This is optimal for any metric cost function on a line.
#'
#' **Rectangular case (n < m):**
#' Uses dynamic programming to find the optimal assignment that matches all n sources
#' to a subset of the m targets, minimizing total distance. The DP recurrence is:
#'
#' \code{dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + cost(x[i], y[j]))}
#' 
#' This finds the minimum cost to match the first i sources to the first j targets.
#' 
#' **Complexity:**
#' - Time: O(n*m) for rectangular, O(n log n) for square
#' - Space: O(n*m) for DP table
#'
#' @return A list with components:
#'   - `match`: Integer vector of length n with 1-based column indices
#'   - `total_cost`: Total cost of the assignment

# Bottleneck Assignment Problem (BAP) Solver
# ==============================================================================

#' Solve the Bottleneck Assignment Problem
#'
#' Finds an assignment that minimizes (or maximizes) the maximum edge cost
#' in a perfect matching. Unlike standard LAP which minimizes the sum of costs,
#' BAP minimizes the maximum (bottleneck) cost.
#'
#' @param cost Numeric matrix; rows = tasks, columns = agents. `NA` or `Inf`
#'   entries are treated as forbidden assignments.
#' @param maximize Logical; if `TRUE`, maximizes the minimum edge cost instead
#'   of minimizing the maximum (maximin objective). Default is `FALSE` (minimax).
#'
#' @return A list with class `"bottleneck_result"` containing:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `match` - integer vector of length `nrow(cost)` giving the
#'           assigned column for each row (1-based indexing)
#'     \item `bottleneck` - numeric scalar, the bottleneck (max/min edge) value
#'     \item `status` - character scalar, e.g. `"optimal"`
#'   }
#'
#' @details
#' The Bottleneck Assignment Problem (BAP) is a variant of the Linear Assignment
#' Problem where instead of minimizing the sum of assignment costs, we minimize
#' the maximum cost among all assignments (minimax objective).
#'
#' **Algorithm:**
#' Uses binary search on the sorted unique costs combined with 'Hopcroft-Karp'
#' bipartite matching to find the minimum threshold that allows a perfect matching.
#'
#' **Complexity:** O(E * sqrt(V) * log(unique costs)) where E = edges, V = vertices.
#'
#' **Applications:**
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Task scheduling with deadline constraints (minimize latest completion)
#'   \item Resource allocation (minimize maximum load/distance)
#'   \item Network routing (minimize maximum link utilization)
#'   \item Fair division problems (minimize maximum disparity)

#' The 'Sinkhorn-Knopp' algorithm solves the entropy-regularized optimal transport
#' problem:
#'
#' \deqn{P^* = \arg\min_P \langle C, P \rangle - \frac{1}{\lambda} H(P)}
#'
#' subject to row sums = r_weights and column sums = c_weights.
#'
#' The entropy term H(P) encourages spread in the transport plan. As lambda -> Inf,

#' the solution approaches the standard (unregularized) optimal transport.
#'
#' **Key differences from standard LAP solvers:**
#' - Returns a soft assignment (probabilities) not a hard 1-to-1 matching
#' - Supports unequal marginals (weighted distributions)
#' - Differentiable, making it useful in ML pipelines
#' - Very fast: O(n^2) per iteration with typically O(1/tol^2) iterations
#'
#' Use [sinkhorn_to_assignment()] to round the soft assignment to a hard matching.
#'
#' @examples
#' cost <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
#'
#' # Soft assignment with default parameters
#' result <- sinkhorn(cost)
#' print(round(result$transport_plan, 3))
#'
#' # Sharper assignment (higher lambda)
#' result_sharp <- sinkhorn(cost, lambda = 50)
#' print(round(result_sharp$transport_plan, 3))
#'
#' # With custom marginals (more mass from row 1)
#' result_weighted <- sinkhorn(cost, r_weights = c(0.5, 0.25, 0.25))

# Assignment with Dual Variables
# ==============================================================================

#' Solve assignment problem and return dual variables
#'
#' Solves the linear assignment problem and returns dual potentials (u, v)
#' in addition to the optimal matching. The dual variables provide an
#' optimality certificate and enable sensitivity analysis.
#'
#' @param cost Numeric matrix; rows = tasks, columns = agents. `NA` or `Inf`
#'   entries are treated as forbidden assignments. A lazy cost specification
#'   from [compute_distances()] is also accepted, and is solved without
#'   materializing the matrix.
#' @param maximize Logical; if `TRUE`, maximizes the total cost instead of minimizing.
#' @param certify Logical; if `TRUE`, the duals are checked against `cost` with
#'   [verify_assignment()] and the resulting `assignment_certificate` is
#'   attached as `certificate`. The check is one pass over the admissible pairs
#'   and reuses the duals computed here, so it costs no second solve.
#'
#' @return A list with class `"assignment_duals_result"` containing:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `match` - integer vector of column assignments (1-based)
#'     \item `total_cost` - optimal objective value
#'     \item `u` - numeric vector of row dual variables (length n)
#'     \item `v` - numeric vector of column dual variables (length m)
#'     \item `status` - character, e.g. "optimal"
#'     \item `certificate` - an `assignment_certificate`, present only under
#'           `certify = TRUE`
#'   }
#'
#' @details
#' The dual variables satisfy the complementary slackness conditions:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item For minimization: `u[i] + v[j] <= cost[i,j]` for all (i,j)
#'   \item For any assigned pair (i,j): `u[i] + v[j] = cost[i,j]`
#' }
#'
#' This implies that `sum(u) + sum(v) = total_cost` (strong duality).
#'
#' **Applications of dual variables:**
#' \itemize{
#'   \item **Optimality verification**: Check that duals satisfy constraints

#'   \item **Sensitivity analysis**: Reduced cost `c[i,j] - u[i] - v[j]` shows
#'         how much an edge cost must decrease before it enters the solution
#'   \item **Pricing in column generation**: Use duals to price new columns
#'   \item **Warm starting**: Reuse duals when costs change slightly
