# ==============================================================================
# Balance as a flow
# ==============================================================================
# The largest matched sample meeting a categorical balance requirement is the
# optimum of a minimum-cost flow problem, and this file is that problem.
# Nothing here searches: the network is built so that its cheapest feasible flow
# is that sample, with balance and then total distance breaking the ties.
#
# Every unit on both sides carries a category at each of H nested levels, level
# 1 the coarsest and level H the finest. Write T_c and K_c for the units of
# finest category c on the left and on the right, a_c and b_c for how many of
# them a matching uses, and
#
#     U_c = max(|T_c|, |K_c|),      K = sum_c U_c.
#
# U_c is a budget of flow forced through category c on each side, and it is the
# maximum rather than the minimum because a category holding only left units
# beside a sibling holding only right ones would otherwise be capped below the
# pairs it can actually reach. The unit arcs cap the real flow at |T_c| and
# |K_c| anyway, so a budget above them buys nothing but slack.
#
# The budget is what turns balance into conservation. Category c on the treated
# side receives exactly U_c and spends it on matched units, on a slack arc, and
# on transfers out; category c on the control side must deliver exactly U_c and
# receives it from matched units, from that same slack arc, and from transfers
# in:
#
#     a_c + s_c + out_c = U_c,      b_c + s_c + in_c = U_c,
#
# so a_c - b_c = in_c - out_c. The slack arc runs from the treated node to the
# control node of the same category, which is what makes s_c the same number in
# both equations, and with no transfer arcs at all it forces a_c = b_c for every
# c: exact fine balance, structurally rather than as a side condition.
#
# Refined balance relaxes that by letting one unit of imbalance travel between
# categories through a pair of port trees. Surplus leaves the treated side at
# the finest level, climbs the OUT tree, crosses to the IN tree at some level,
# and descends to the control side of another category. A crossing at level h
# joins two cells that agree down to level h and differ from level h+1 on, so it
# is a unit of imbalance at exactly the levels finer than h, and the lowest
# level at which the two cells meet is their lowest common ancestor: nothing
# crosses below it, and crossing above it costs strictly more. Pricing a
# crossing at level h at
#
#     P + gamma_h,      gamma_h = sum_{l > h} eps_l,
#
# therefore makes it pay eps_l once for each level l at which it stands as an
# imbalance. The leading P is not a second charge for the same thing: every unit
# leaving the source arrives at the sink as a pair, as slack, or as a transfer,
# so
#
#     pairs = K - S - T,
#
# and the P on a transfer stands in for the slack unit the transfer displaced.
# The arc costs then total
#
#     P * (K - pairs) + sum_h eps_h * imbalance_h + sum_ij d_ij x_ij,
#
#     imbalance_h = (1/2) sum_{c at level h} |a_c - b_c|,
#
# which is the lexicographic objective the design asks for: cardinality first,
# then balance from the coarsest level down, then distance. eps_1 > ... > eps_H
# and P above all of them come from .lex_tier_weights(), which owns the
# precision argument.
#
# `exact` names how many of the coarsest levels admit no crossing above them.
# With crossings only at levels exact .. H-1 no unit of imbalance can leave a
# level-`exact` cell, so balance at levels 1 .. exact holds exactly and the
# finer levels are priced. exact = H is fine balance on the finest partition;
# exact = 0 prices every level, including the coarsest, through a crossing at
# the root.
#
# The tree arcs above the finest level carry forced bounds rather than free
# ones. A free arc would let the treated and the control side of one cell draw
# different amounts from their parent, and that difference would buy imbalance
# no crossing had paid for; forcing every level's budget is what keeps
# a_c - b_c equal to in_c - out_c at every cell instead of only in total.
#
# Node ids are 1-based and follow the convention in src/flow/flow_problem.h:
# source, sink, left units, right units, then the design's own nodes.
# .balance_node_layout() is the only place a node id is computed.
