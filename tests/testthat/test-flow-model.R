# The R side of the flow model: the door a problem comes through, the solve, and
# the certificate.
#
# The C++ tests in cpp_tests/ own the solver and the certifier. What is checked
# here is what only exists in R: that a malformed problem is named in R terms
# before it reaches a solver that can only speak in node indices, that the three
# steps stay separable, and that verify_flow() is a check rather than a report.
# A certificate that passed on potentials it never looked at would prove nothing,
# so every failing condition below is asserted to fail.

# has one; node 3 wants two and node 4 wants one. Its optimum is unique: both of
