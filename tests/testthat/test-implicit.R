# memory_mode = "implicit": the public surface of the edge-generation loop.
#
# The 298 Catch2 cases in cpp_tests/ own the loop itself -- the restricted
# master, the pricing round, the feasibility phase and the certificate the three
# of them assemble. What this file covers is the layer above them: the
# orientation the loop is handed, the answer read back in the caller's units,
# the certificate and the search record arriving where a caller finds them, and
# the designs the mode declines rather than solving as something they are not.
#
# The claim every equality test makes is condition 1: the loop's answer is the
# answer a solve over every pair gives, on the same numbers, in the same
# session. It is asserted on the total rather than on the match vector, because
# the two paths reach an optimum through different arc sets and are free to name
# different ones whenever the optimum is not unique.
