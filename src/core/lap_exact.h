// Exact sign of c - u - v over IEEE doubles, with no tolerance anywhere.
// Pure C++, no Rcpp, so the C++ test harness reaches it as well as the
// certificate does.
//
// Every condition the optimality certificate checks reduces to one question
// asked of three numbers: is c_ij - u_i - v_j positive, zero, or negative. A
// double is a rational number, p / 2^k with p and k integers, so that question
// has an exact answer. A verifier deciding it within a band around zero is
// making a statement about a neighbourhood of the instance rather than about
// the instance: at tolerance eps it accepts potentials that violate dual
// feasibility by eps on any pair and miss tightness by eps on any matched arc,
// which bounds the matching's excess over the optimum by about
// 2 (nrow + ncol) eps rather than pinning it at zero.
//
// Setting the band to zero and reading the sign of the double evaluation is
// not the fix, because that sign can be wrong. With c = 2^-60, u = 1 and
// v = -1 the first subtraction rounds to -1 and the expression returns 0 on a
// pair whose reduced cost is positive; at c = -2^-60 it returns 0 on a pair
// whose reduced cost is negative, which is a dual infeasibility a zero-band
// check would accept.
//
// The band goes away once the expression is evaluated exactly. Knuth's two-sum
// splits a rounded addition into the sum plus the part that rounding lost, both
// doubles, and both together equal to the true value. Applying it twice writes
// c - u - v as a non-overlapping expansion of three doubles whose sum is the
// exact difference; the sign of that sum is the sign of its most significant
// non-zero component. The technique and the non-overlap property are
// Shewchuk's (1997, "Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and Fast
// Robust Geometric Predicates").
//
// The expansion costs about ten flops against two, so it runs behind a filter:
// a rounding-error bound on the double evaluation decides the pairs that are
// clear of zero, and only pairs inside the bound are expanded. On a dense scan
// almost every pair is clear, and the pairs that are not are the tight ones,
// which are the ones worth the arithmetic.
