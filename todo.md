# couplr Algorithm Integration TODO

## Completed
- [x] Network Simplex implementation (all 20 tests passing)
- [x] Orlin-Ahuja solver
- [x] Push-Relabel solver
- [x] Ramshaw-Tarjan rectangular solver
- [x] Assignment duals extraction
- [x] All algorithms added to `assignment()` main routine
- [x] Run `devtools::document()` to regenerate `.Rd` documentation
- [x] Update `_pkgdown.yml` with new functions (assignment_duals, bottleneck_assignment, sinkhorn, sinkhorn_to_assignment)
- [x] Rebuild pkgdown website using `build_site.R`
- [x] Commit network simplex changes (b9a3094)
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with new algorithms (7861e87)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation update for all 20 algorithms (8db9f55)
  - Reorganized `@param method` into categorized groups
  - Expanded algorithms vignette with 6 new algorithm sections
  - Added specialized functions section (duals, bottleneck, sinkhorn)
  - Updated quick reference and performance tables

## All Done!
