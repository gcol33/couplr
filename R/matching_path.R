# ==============================================================================
# Design paths: one matching per knob value, solved as one loop
# ==============================================================================
# A caliper is a modelling choice, and the way to make it is to look at what the
# matching does across a range of values. Doing that by calling match_couples()
# once per value solves the same problem from cold every time, and the values
# are not independent problems: ascending, each one is the last one with pairs
# added. Every arc the previous value placed is still an arc, every cost it
# reported is unchanged, and the matching it found is still a feasible matching.
#
# So a path point is the edge-generation loop run again over what the previous
# point left behind, with the new pairs supplied by the widening instead of by a
# pricing round. The state that carries -- the compiled problem, the flow, the
# candidate set, the structure the pairs are found through -- lives in C++ and
# stays there for the whole sweep (src/flow/flow_path.h).
#
# Direction is a correctness requirement rather than a preference. Widening adds
# pairs and leaves the incumbent matching feasible; narrowing withdraws pairs
# the matching may be standing on, which is a repair this loop does not do. A
# descending sweep is refused and told why rather than sorted behind the
# caller's back, because a caller who wrote one meant something else.

# The knobs a path can sweep. A knob is the name of the `match_couples()`
# argument the path moves, what a value of it means, and what makes a value
# legal; adding one is an entry here and an entry point beside
# `lap_match_path_lazy()`.

#' Match across a range of one design choice
#'
#' Solves the matching once for each value of one argument and returns what
#' happened at each: how many units were matched, at what total distance, how
#' balanced the matched sample is, and the certificate saying the matching is
#' optimal for that value. The points are solved as one sequence rather than one
#' at a time, each starting from the matching the previous value found.
#'
#' `values` must ascend. Each point is solved from the point before it, which
#' works because a wider value only ever adds pairs to choose from; a descending
#' sweep takes pairs away from a matching already using them, and is refused
#' rather than reordered.
#'
#' @param left,right Data frames to match. Both are required.
#' @param vars Character vector of matching variables, present in both.
#' @param vary The argument to sweep. `"max_distance"` sweeps the distance cut.
#' @param values The values to sweep it through, ascending.
#' @param distance Distance metric, as in [match_couples()].
#' @param weights,scale,auto_scale,sigma Distance construction, as in
#'   [match_couples()].
#' @param calipers Per-variable calipers held fixed across the path, as in
#'   [match_couples()].
#' Balance is read on the caller's own variables rather than on the coordinates
#' the solver worked in, so a scaled or weighted distance does not change the
#' scale the balance is reported on. It is the same reading [balance_diagnostics()]
#' gives for a single matching, taken at every point of the sweep.
#'
#' @param certify Whether each point carries a checked certificate. `TRUE` by
#'   default: the certificate is what says a point's matching is the optimal one
#'   for its value, which is the claim a path is read for.
#' @param left_id,right_id Name of the column holding the unit identifier, or
#'   NULL (default) to use a column called `id`, then meaningful row names,
#'   then synthesized ids with a warning. See [match_couples()].
#' @param keep_per_row,width,tol,max_rounds The edge-generation loop's search
#'   knobs, shared with `memory_mode = "implicit"`. Each point converges on any
#'   of them.
#'
#' @return An object of class `couplr_path`: `$path`, one row per point,
#'   `$balance`, one row per point per variable, and the match vector,
#'   certificate, round record and Hall witness for each of them.
