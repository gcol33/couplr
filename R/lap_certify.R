# ==============================================================================
# Optimality certificates
# ==============================================================================
# A certificate is checkable, so its producer never has to be trusted. Given a
# matching M and any candidate duals u, v, the conditions below either prove M
# optimal for the complete problem or fail. Duals invented by a broken solver
# fail. That is why verify_assignment() accepts duals from the same solver that
# produced the matching without circularity: they are input to a check, not an
# answer.
#
# For the rectangular minimum-cost assignment LP with every row matched
#
#   min  sum_ij c_ij x_ij
#   s.t. sum_j x_ij  = 1  for every row i
#        sum_i x_ij <= 1  for every column j
#        x >= 0
#
# the dual is
#
#   max  sum_i u_i + sum_j v_j
#   s.t. u_i + v_j <= c_ij  for every admissible pair
#        v_j <= 0           when there are more columns than rows
#
# and optimality follows from primal feasibility, dual feasibility, and
# complementary slackness in both halves: matched arcs tight, and v_j = 0 on
# every column no row matched.
#
# Each of those conditions is the sign of c_ij - u_i - v_j, and a double is a
# rational number, so each has an exact answer. The check evaluates that sign
# exactly rather than reading the sign of a rounded difference, and the
# certificate says which arithmetic its conclusion is in. The tolerance is what
# remains for the case the exact conditions do not hold: duals that are optimal
# for the matrix in the reals but miss exact tightness by the rounding of the
# arithmetic that produced them.
#
# The sign condition is conditional because the dual objective sums v over all
# columns while a feasible assignment only pays for the ones it uses. With more
# columns than rows any column can be left out, so none may contribute a
# positive term; with as many rows as columns every assignment uses every
# column, the two sums coincide, and v is unrestricted. Jonker-Volgenant returns
# free-sign duals on a square problem, and they are correct there.
#
# The second half is not optional. A verifier checking only dual feasibility and
# tightness on matched arcs certifies a solution whose dual bound equals the
# true optimum while its primal cost sits above it, because a freed column
# carries v_j < 0.
# ==============================================================================

#' Verify that an assignment is optimal
#'
#' Checks a solved assignment against the linear-programming optimality
#' conditions and returns the result of each check. Unlike the `status` field on
#' a solve result, which records what the solver terminated on, this is a
#' statement about the matching: `certified_optimal` is `TRUE` only when every
#' condition holds.
#'
#' # What the certificate proves
#'
#' The conditions are decided in one of two arithmetics, and the certificate
#' says which one it used.
#'
#' An **exact certificate** decides every condition in exact arithmetic, with no
#' tolerance anywhere. It proves that the matching attains the minimum total
#' cost of the cost matrix as supplied. The three quantities in each condition
#' are IEEE doubles, and a double is a rational number, so `c_ij - u_i - v_j`
#' has an exact sign; the check evaluates that sign exactly rather than reading
#' the sign of a rounded difference. A cost matrix that is itself a rounding of
#' something else — Mahalanobis distances, say — is still certified as the
#' matrix it is, which is the problem the solver was given.
#'
#' A **numerical certificate** decides the same conditions within `tol`. It
#' establishes optimality up to that tolerance and no further. It is what is
#' available when the potentials are not exactly optimal for the matrix: a
#' potential computed as `c_ij - v_j` misses exact tightness by the rounding of
#' that subtraction, and a matched arc off by one unit in the last place is
#' enough to put the exact conclusion out of reach.
#'
#' Which of the two an instance supports is a property of the arithmetic that
#' produced the potentials, so it is worth checking rather than assuming.
#' Integer costs and costs drawn on the unit interval have given an exact
#' certificate on every instance we have measured, across problem sizes, both
#' orientations of a rectangular problem, and every solver. Costs that are
#' themselves computed, such as Euclidean distances between covariate vectors,
#' have given a numerical one, with matched arcs off by a relative `1e-16` to
#' `1e-15`.
#'
#' The check needs dual variables. If `x` carries them (as
#' [assignment_duals()] results do), they are used. Otherwise they are obtained
#' by solving `cost` with [assignment_duals()], which costs a second solve.
#' Either way the duals are verified, not trusted: dual feasibility is checked
#' over every admissible pair, so duals that do not certify anything cause the
#' verification to fail rather than pass.
#'
#' Optimal duals are shared by all optimal solutions of a linear program, so a
#' matching from one solver can be certified against duals from another. That is
#' what makes it possible to certify solvers that return no duals of their own.
#'
#' @param x A `lap_solve_result` (from [assignment()]), an
#'   `assignment_duals_result` (from [assignment_duals()]), or an integer vector
#'   of assigned columns per row with `0` for unmatched.
#' @param cost Numeric cost matrix the assignment was computed on, or a lazy
#'   cost specification from [compute_distances()]. Required unless `x` already
#'   carries one.
#' @param duals Optional list with elements `u` and `v` giving row and column
#'   potentials in the orientation of `cost`. Overrides any duals on `x`.
#' @param maximize Logical; whether the assignment maximized rather than
#'   minimized. Defaults to `FALSE`.
#' @param tol Numeric tolerance for the feasibility and slackness comparisons of
#'   a numerical certificate, ignored by an exact one. The duality-gap
#'   comparison scales it by the magnitude of the objective, since an absolute
#'   tolerance on a sum of many terms is not reachable in double precision.
#' @param arithmetic One of `"auto"`, `"exact"` or `"double"`. `"auto"`, the
#'   default, reports the exact conclusion when the exact conditions hold and
#'   the numerical one otherwise, which is the strongest statement the instance
#'   supports; the exact conditions imply the numerical ones at any
#'   non-negative `tol`, so `"auto"` certifies nothing `"double"` would refuse.
#'   `"exact"` refuses to fall back, so `certified_optimal` is then `TRUE` only
#'   on an exact certificate. `"double"` decides everything within `tol`.
#'
#' @return An object of class `assignment_certificate`, a list with elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `certified_optimal` — logical, the conclusion. `TRUE` only when
#'         every condition below holds.
#'   \item `arithmetic` — `"exact"` or `"double"`, the arithmetic the
#'         conclusion was reached in.
#'   \item `exact_certificate` — logical; whether the conditions hold in exact
#'         arithmetic. `arithmetic = "double"` does not ask the question, and
#'         reports `FALSE` here and in `exact_available`.
#'   \item `exact_available` — logical; whether the exact question was asked of
#'         every condition. It is `FALSE` under `arithmetic = "double"`, and on
#'         a certificate assembled from a scan that priced part of the problem
#'         against a tolerance rather than evaluating it, which is what the
#'         edge-generation loop hands back.
#'   \item `n_exact_violations`, `n_exact_untight` — pairs failing exact dual
#'         feasibility, and matched pairs not exactly tight.
#'   \item `structurally_valid_matching` — logical; no column claimed twice, no
#'         forbidden pair matched, no index out of range. Unmatched rows are
#'         permitted, so this holds for a partial matching.
#'   \item `all_rows_matched` — logical; every row of the short side holds a
#'         column.
#'   \item `primal_feasible` — logical; both of the two above. The primal
#'         constrains every row of the short side to hold exactly one pair, so
#'         a partial matching is a valid matching and not a feasible solution,
#'         and no conclusion rests on it. `primal_objective` is still reported
#'         for one, since an unmatched row costs nothing and leaves the sum
#'         meaningful.
#'   \item `dual_feasible` — logical; `c_ij - u_i - v_j >= -tol` over every
#'         admissible pair, and, when there are more columns than rows,
#'         `v_j <= tol` for every column.
#'   \item `complementary_slackness` — logical; both halves.
#'   \item `cs_matched_tight`, `cs_unmatched_free` — the two halves separately.
#'   \item `primal_objective`, `dual_objective`, `duality_gap` — numeric.
#'   \item `max_suboptimality` — numeric; the most any feasible solution can
#'         beat this one by, in the cost unit. It adds to the duality gap the
#'         slack the dual conditions were allowed: `n_rows` times the depth the
#'         reduced costs were permitted below zero, plus, where the sign
#'         condition applies, `n_cols` times the height the column duals were
#'         permitted above it, plus an envelope for each objective's own
#'         rounding. Compensated summation buys back the accumulation error
#'         rather than removing it, so each sum is charged
#'         `(2u + gamma_n^2)` times the sum of its terms' magnitudes and the
#'         assembly is rounded outward at every step. The number is an upper
#'         bound in double arithmetic and not an estimate of one. It is zero
#'         only where every one of those terms is exactly zero, which is what
#'         `certified_optimal` reports. `NA` when `primal_feasible` is
#'         `FALSE`: the quantity is what a feasible solution can beat this
#'         one by, and there is no answer for a candidate that is not one.
#'   \item `certified_reduced_cost_floor` — numeric; the lower bound proved for
#'         the reduced cost of every admissible pair, the ones never evaluated
#'         included. Equal to `min_reduced_cost` when every pair was visited,
#'         and below it when a pruning pricer proved only its own threshold.
#'   \item `min_reduced_cost`, `worst_i`, `worst_j` — the most violated pair, if
#'         any.
#'   \item `max_matched_slack`, `max_v_unmatched`, `max_v` — the quantities the
#'         slackness and sign conditions bound.
#'   \item `n_matched`, `n_rows`, `n_cols`, `transposed`, `tolerance`.
