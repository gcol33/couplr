#' Cardinality Matching
#'
#' Maximizes the number of matched pairs subject to balance constraints, and
#' reports how far the matched sample sits from the largest one the constraints
#' admit.
#'
#' @param left Data frame of "left" units, one row each.
#' @param right Data frame of "right" units, one row each.
#' @param vars Character vector of matching variable names.
#' @param fine Exact fine balance on one partition: a character vector of
#'   column names, cross-classified, or a one-sided formula. In a formula `+`
#'   and `:` both mean interaction, so `~ region + sex` and `~ region:sex` both
#'   ask for balance on every region-by-sex cell. `fine = X` is the same
#'   request as `refined = list(X), refined_exact = 1`.
#' @param refined A nested hierarchy of groupings, coarsest first: a list, each
#'   element a character vector or one-sided formula, or a character vector as
#'   shorthand for its own sequence of prefixes, so `c("region", "site")` means
#'   region, then region crossed with site. Each level must sit inside the one
#'   before it.
#' @param refined_exact How many of the coarsest levels of `refined` are
#'   enforced exactly (default: 1). The remaining levels are balanced as closely
#'   as the exact levels allow.
#' @param moments Moment constraints beyond `max_std_diff`: a named numeric of
#'   standardized-difference bounds, as in `c(x = 0.05, y = 0.1)`, or a list of
#'   entries with fields `var`, `stat` (`"std_diff"` or `"mean_diff"`),
#'   `transform`, `max` and `min`. A variable bounded here must not also be
#'   bounded by `max_std_diff`.
#' @param max_std_diff Maximum absolute standardized difference on every
#'   variable in `vars` (default: `Inf`, stating no such constraint). A finite
#'   value states one moment row per variable and per direction, which is what
#'   sends a call to the Lagrangian search; see Details.
#' @param engine Which solver answers the problem: `"flow"` for a single
#'   min-cost flow solve, available when no moment row is stated;
#'   `"branch_bound"` for the Lagrangian search moment rows need; `"auto"`
#'   (default) for whichever of the two the stated constraints call for; and
#'   `"heuristic"` for the pruning loop.
#' @param distance Distance metric (default: "euclidean").
#' @param weights Optional named vector of variable weights.
#' @param scale Scaling method (default: FALSE).
#' @param auto_scale If TRUE, check variable health and select scaling
#'   automatically (default: FALSE).
#' @param sigma Bandwidth for the distance metrics that take one.
#' @param max_distance Pairs farther apart than this are not available.
#' @param calipers Named vector of per-variable caliper widths.
#' @param left_id,right_id Name of the id column on each side. When absent, ids
#'   come from an `id` column, from row names, or are synthesized.
#' @param time_limit Seconds the search may run (default: 30).
#' @param node_limit Nodes the search may open (default: 500).
#' @param method LAP solver method for the heuristic's initial match
#'   (default: "auto"). Reaches `engine = "heuristic"` only.
#' @param max_iter Maximum pruning iterations (default: 100). Reaches
#'   `engine = "heuristic"` only.
#' @param batch_fraction Fraction of the remaining pairs the heuristic deletes
#'   per iteration (default: 0.1). Reaches `engine = "heuristic"` only.
#'
#' @return A `matching_result` object. Beyond the fields every matching carries
#'   it holds:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `cardinality` - the report: `n_matched`, `best_possible`, `gap`,
#'       `gap_fraction`, `certified`, `stopped_on`, `n_nodes`, and the state of
#'       every stated constraint. See [print.cardinality_report()].
#'     \item `certificate` - present when the search certified optimality.
#'     \item `status` - `"optimal"`, `"iteration_limit"`, or `"heuristic"`.
#'     \item `info$engine` - the engine that answered.
#'   }
#'   `info$pruning_iterations` and `info$pairs_removed` are carried by
#'   `engine = "heuristic"`.
#'
#' @details
#' Cardinality matching (Zubizarreta 2012) asks for the largest matched sample
#' that satisfies stated balance constraints, rather than the closest one. The
#' constraints come in two kinds, and which kinds are stated decides how the
#' problem is solved.
#'
#' Fine and refined covariate balance are representable in the matching network
#' itself (Rosenbaum, Ross and Silber 2007; Pimentel, Kelz, Silber and
#' Rosenbaum 2015): every category becomes a node, and a single min-cost flow
#' solve returns the largest balanced sample together with a dual certificate
#' of its optimality, at polynomial cost. `max_std_diff` defaults to `Inf`,
#' stating no moment constraint, so a call asking for fine or refined balance
#' alone takes this path and comes back certified:
#'
#' ```
#' cardinality_match(left, right, vars, fine = "region")
#' ```
#'
#' Linear moment constraints -- a bound on a standardized or mean difference --
#' cut across the network and are dualized instead. Their multipliers are
#' updated per node, the Lagrangian value bounds the subtree, and the search
#' branches on unit inclusion until the bound meets the incumbent or a budget
#' runs out. A finite `max_std_diff` states one such constraint per variable
#' and per direction, so it is what moves a call onto this path, and
#' `node_limit` and `time_limit` are what end it when the bound does not close.
#' The report says which happened: `certified` is `TRUE` only when the search
#' settled and the gap is zero, and `gap` says how many matched units separate
#' the answer from the bound when it is not.
#'
#' How long the search runs depends on whether the moment bounds bind. When the
#' distance-minimizing match already satisfies them, which happens with a loose
#' bound or with a `right` pool large enough that the closest partners are
#' already balanced, the root node certifies and the call returns in
#' milliseconds. When they bind, every node costs a flow solve, and although
#' the root enters a feasible incumbent before the first node is opened, the
#' bound above it closes slowly, so a call can spend its whole budget and still
#' report a gap. Set `node_limit` and
#' `time_limit` to a budget you are willing to spend, and read `stopped_on` and
#' `gap` to see what the budget bought.
#'
#' The objective is lexicographic. Matched cardinality comes first, total
#' distance second, so a pair is never added at the cost of a match and never
#' dropped to shorten one.
#'
#' `engine = "heuristic"` runs a pruning loop instead: a full match, then
#' repeated deletion of the pairs carrying the worst variable's imbalance. Its
#' properties follow from the loop. It starts from a full match and deletes
#' pairs, and never re-adds one, so it cannot recover from an over-aggressive
#' deletion. It never maximizes cardinality, it only shrinks a starting match.
#' It considers one variable per iteration, the current worst, so balance on
#' the others is incidental. It computes no bound, so it cannot say how far its
#' answer sits from the largest balanced sample; `best_possible` and `gap` are
#' `NA` and `certified` is `FALSE`.
