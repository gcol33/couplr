# couplr: Optimal Pairing and Matching via Linear Assignment

Solves optimal pairing and matching problems using linear assignment
algorithms. Provides modern, tidy implementations of Hungarian,
Jonker-Volgenant, Auction, and other LAP solvers. Designed for matching
plots, sites, samples, or any pairwise optimization problem. Supports
rectangular matrices, forbidden assignments, data frame inputs, batch
solving, k-best solutions, and pixel-level image morphing for
visualization. Includes automatic preprocessing with variable health
checks, multiple scaling methods (standardized, range, robust), greedy
matching algorithms, and comprehensive balance diagnostics for assessing
match quality using standardized differences and distribution
comparisons.
