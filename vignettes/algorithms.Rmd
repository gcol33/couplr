The Hungarian algorithm was published in 1955. Sixty years later, most R packages still use nothing else.

couplr implements **twenty algorithms** spanning five decades of research—including methods that exist in no other R package. Gabow-Tarjan. Orlin-Ahuja. Network Simplex. Ramshaw-Tarjan. Names you might recognize from textbooks, implemented here in production C++.

This vignette explains why they exist and when each one matters.

But first: the same problem, five different solutions.

When you run five different assignment algorithms on identical input, they all find the same optimal answer—but the fastest finishes **22 times quicker** than the slowest.

The slowest happens to be Hungarian, the algorithm everyone learns in textbooks. CSA, the fastest here, came out four decades later. That gap represents years of algorithmic refinement that most production software never adopted.

Why would anyone need five ways to solve the same problem? Because they don't all behave the same under different conditions. The Hungarian method that handles a 100×100 matrix without complaint becomes painfully slow at 1000×1000. The Auction algorithm that dominates large dense problems stumbles on small sparse ones. Different matrix sizes, different sparsity patterns, different cost distributions—each situation favors a different algorithm.

couplr gives you all of them, and it picks the right one automatically.

## The Problem

Before the algorithms, the problem. It's simple to state:

> Given $n$ workers and $n$ jobs, where assigning worker $i$ to job $j$ costs $c_{ij}$, find the assignment that minimizes total cost.

Mathematically:

$$
\min_{\pi} \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i,\pi(i)}
$$

where $\pi$ is a permutation (each worker gets exactly one job, each job gets exactly one worker).

```{r bipartite-graph, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Bipartite graph showing workers on left, jobs on right, with weighted edges and optimal assignment highlighted"}
# Build graph with tidygraph
nodes <- tibble(
  name = c("W1", "W2", "W3", "J1", "J2", "J3"),
  type = c(rep("Worker", 3), rep("Job", 3)),
  side = c(rep("left", 3), rep("right", 3))
)

edges <- tibble(
  from = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3),
  to = c(4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 6),
  cost = c(2, 4, 1, 3, 3, 2),
  optimal = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
)

g <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = FALSE)

# Manual bipartite layout
layout <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2),
  y = c(3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1)
)

ggraph(g, layout = "manual", x = layout$x, y = layout$y) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_colour = optimal, edge_width = optimal, label = cost),
                 angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(2.5, "mm"),
                 label_size = 3.5, fontface = "bold") +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type), shape = 21, size = 14, color = "white", stroke = 1.5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 4.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Worker" = col_worker, "Job" = col_job), name = NULL) +
  scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("TRUE" = col_optimal, "FALSE" = col_nonopt), guide = "none") +
  scale_edge_width_manual(values = c("TRUE" = 1.5, "FALSE" = 0.8), guide = "none") +
  labs(title = "Assignment as Bipartite Matching",
       subtitle = "Optimal: W1→J1 (2) + W2→J2 (1) + W3→J3 (2) = 5") +
  theme_graph_clean() +
  coord_fixed(clip = "off")
```

Simple to state. Not simple to solve efficiently.

There are $n!$ possible assignments. For $n = 20$, that's 2.4 quintillion possibilities. Brute force is impossible. We need structure.

The insight that unlocks efficient algorithms: **duality**. Every assignment problem has a dual problem involving "prices" for workers and jobs. When the prices are right, the optimal assignment reveals itself.

Different algorithms exploit this duality in different ways.

## The Classics

### Hungarian Algorithm (1955)

The algorithm everyone learns. Published by Harold Kuhn, based on work by Hungarian mathematicians Kőnig and Egerváry.

**The idea**: Maintain dual prices $(u_i, v_j)$ such that $u_i + v_j \leq c_{ij}$ for all pairs. Edges where equality holds are "tight"—the only edges that can appear in an optimal solution.

```{r hungarian-diagram, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Hungarian algorithm showing alternating path augmentation through tight edges"}
# Nodes: 4 workers, 4 jobs
nodes <- tibble(
 name = c("W1", "W2", "W3", "W4", "J1", "J2", "J3", "J4"),
 type = c(rep("Worker", 4), rep("Job", 4)),
 state = c("matched", "matched", "seeking", "matched",
           "matched", "matched", "free", "matched")
)

# Edges: matched + tight + augmenting path
edges <- tibble(
 from = c(1, 2, 4,  3, 3, 3, 2),
 to = c(5, 6, 8,    7, 6, 5, 7),
 edge_type = factor(c("Matched", "Matched", "Matched",
                      "Tight", "Augmenting", "Tight", "Augmenting"),
                    levels = c("Matched", "Augmenting", "Tight"))
)

g <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = FALSE)

layout <- data.frame(
 x = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5),
 y = c(4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1)
)

ggraph(g, layout = "manual", x = layout$x, y = layout$y) +
 geom_edge_link(aes(edge_colour = edge_type, edge_width = edge_type,
                    edge_linetype = edge_type)) +
 geom_node_point(aes(fill = ifelse(state == "seeking", "Seeking",
                                   ifelse(state == "free", "Free", type))),
                 shape = 21, size = 12, color = "white", stroke = 1.5) +
 geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
 scale_fill_manual(values = c("Worker" = col_worker, "Job" = col_job,
                              "Seeking" = col_highlight, "Free" = col_optimal),
                   name = "Node") +
 scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("Matched" = col_job, "Augmenting" = col_highlight,
                                     "Tight" = col_nonopt), name = "Edge") +
 scale_edge_width_manual(values = c("Matched" = 1.2, "Augmenting" = 1.2, "Tight" = 0.6),
                         guide = "none") +
 scale_edge_linetype_manual(values = c("Matched" = "solid", "Augmenting" = "solid",
                                       "Tight" = "dashed"), guide = "none") +
 labs(title = "Hungarian: Augmenting Path Search",
      subtitle = "W3 (red) finds path to free job J3 (green) via tight edges") +
 theme_graph_clean() +
 coord_fixed(clip = "off")
```

**The algorithm**:

1. Initialize prices. Find tight edges.
2. Find a maximum matching using only tight edges.
3. If the matching is complete, done.
4. Otherwise, update prices to create new tight edges. Repeat.

**Complexity**: $O(n^3)$

**The problem**: That $O(n^3)$ hides a large constant. The price updates and augmenting path searches are expensive. For a 1000×1000 matrix, you might wait 10+ seconds.

```{r hungarian-example}
cost <- matrix(c(10, 19, 8, 15, 10, 11, 9, 12, 14), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "hungarian")
print(result)
```

Hungarian works. It's pedagogically beautiful. But in 1987, two Dutch researchers found something faster.

### Jonker-Volgenant Algorithm (1987)

Roy Jonker and Anton Volgenant asked: what if we start with a good guess and fix it?

**The key insight**: Column reduction. Before any sophisticated search, greedily assign each row to its cheapest available column. This often gets most of the matching right immediately.

```{r jv-diagram, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="JV algorithm showing column reduction initialization followed by shortest path augmentation"}
# JV visualization: cleaner flow diagram
steps <- data.frame(
  step = c("Column\nReduction", "Reduction\nTransfer", "Augmentation"),
  description = c(
    "Greedily assign rows\nto cheapest columns",
    "Handle collisions\nwith dual updates",
    "Shortest-path search\nfor remaining rows"
  ),
  progress = c("85%", "95%", "100%"),
  x = c(1, 2.5, 4),
  phase_color = c(col_job, col_job, col_optimal)
)

ggplot(steps) +
 # Connecting arrows (curved would be nice but keeping simple)
  annotate("segment", x = 1.55, xend = 1.95, y = 0.5, yend = 0.5,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"), type = "closed"),
           color = col_nonopt, linewidth = 1.5) +
 annotate("segment", x = 3.05, xend = 3.45, y = 0.5, yend = 0.5,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"), type = "closed"),
           color = col_nonopt, linewidth = 1.5) +
  # Phase boxes with rounded appearance
  geom_tile(aes(x = x, y = 0.5, fill = phase_color),
            width = 1.1, height = 1.4, color = "white", linewidth = 1.5) +
  # Step titles
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = 0.85, label = step),
            color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 4.5, lineheight = 0.85) +
  # Progress indicators
  geom_label(aes(x = x, y = 0.1, label = progress),
             fill = "white", color = col_text, size = 5, fontface = "bold",
             label.padding = unit(0.3, "lines"), label.size = 0) +
  scale_fill_identity() +
  # Description annotations below (use #3E3F3A for dark mode compatibility)
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = -0.55, label = description),
            size = 3.2, lineheight = 0.9, color = "#3E3F3A") +
  labs(title = "Jonker-Volgenant: Start Fast, Fix Later",
       subtitle = "Column reduction handles most assignments; Dijkstra-style augmentation finishes the rest") +
  theme_diagram() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 0.7, xlim = c(0.2, 4.8), ylim = c(-1, 1.4))
```

**The algorithm**:

1. **Column reduction**: For each column, find the two smallest costs. The difference is the "advantage" of the best row.
2. **Reduction transfer**: Assign rows to columns, handling conflicts by dual variable updates.
3. **Augmentation**: For any remaining unmatched rows, use Dijkstra-style shortest path search.

**Complexity**: Still $O(n^3)$, but with a much smaller constant. Often 10-50× faster than Hungarian in practice.

```{r jv-example}
set.seed(123)
n <- 500
cost <- matrix(runif(n * n, 0, 100), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "jv"))
cat("Total cost:", round(get_total_cost(result), 2), "\n")
```

JV became the de facto standard. For dense problems up to a few thousand rows, it's hard to beat.

But JV has a limitation: it's fundamentally serial. Each augmenting path depends on the previous. For very large problems, we need a different approach.

## The Scaling Revolution

In the late 1980s, researchers discovered a powerful trick called **ε-scaling**. The idea is to relax the optimality requirement: instead of demanding exact answers at every step, you tolerate a small error ε. You start with a large ε, which lets you make big sloppy steps and rapid progress. Then you shrink ε over multiple phases until it's essentially zero—and you have an exact answer.

This transforms how the algorithm behaves. Large ε means big steps and rapid progress; small ε means careful refinement. The total work can end up being less than doing everything exactly from the start.

Four algorithms exploit this insight: Auction, CSA, Gabow-Tarjan, and Orlin-Ahuja.

---

### Auction Algorithm (1988)

Dimitri Bertsekas asked: what if we thought of assignment as an economics problem?

**The metaphor**: Workers are buyers. Jobs are goods. Each job has a price. Workers bid for their favorite jobs. Prices rise when there's competition. Equilibrium = optimal assignment.

```{r auction-diagram, fig.width=7, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Auction algorithm bidding process showing workers bidding for jobs with prices"}
# Nodes with prices for jobs
nodes <- tibble(
  name = c("W1", "W2", "W3", "J1\n$5", "J2\n$3", "J3\n$0"),
  type = c(rep("Worker", 3), rep("Job", 3)),
  state = c("bidding", "matched", "waiting", "target", "matched", "available")
)

# Edges: bid, considering, matched
edges <- tibble(
  from = c(1, 1, 2),
  to = c(4, 5, 5),
  edge_type = factor(c("Bid", "Considering", "Matched"),
                     levels = c("Bid", "Matched", "Considering"))
)

g <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = TRUE)

layout <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 0, 0, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5),
  y = c(3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1)
)

ggraph(g, layout = "manual", x = layout$x, y = layout$y) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_colour = edge_type, edge_width = edge_type,
                     edge_linetype = edge_type),
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(3, "mm"), type = "closed"),
                 end_cap = circle(8, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = ifelse(state == "bidding", "Bidding",
                                    ifelse(state == "matched", "Matched",
                                           ifelse(type == "Worker", "Worker", "Job")))),
                  shape = 21, size = 12, color = "white", stroke = 1.5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 3.5,
                 lineheight = 0.9) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Worker" = col_worker, "Job" = col_job,
                               "Bidding" = col_highlight, "Matched" = col_optimal),
                    name = "Node") +
  scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("Bid" = col_highlight, "Matched" = col_optimal,
                                      "Considering" = col_nonopt), name = "Edge") +
  scale_edge_width_manual(values = c("Bid" = 1.2, "Matched" = 1.2, "Considering" = 0.6),
                          guide = "none") +
  scale_edge_linetype_manual(values = c("Bid" = "solid", "Matched" = "solid",
                                        "Considering" = "dashed"), guide = "none") +
  labs(title = "Auction: Bidding Phase",
       subtitle = "W1 (red) bids on J1; W2 already matched to J2") +
  theme_graph_clean() +
  coord_fixed(clip = "off")
```

**The algorithm**:

1. Each unassigned worker finds their best job (highest value minus price).
2. The worker bids: new price = old price + (best value - second-best value) + ε.
3. If someone else held that job, they become unassigned.
4. Repeat until everyone is assigned.

**Why ε matters**: Without ε, two workers could bid infinitely against each other, each raising the price by 0. The ε ensures progress.

**Complexity**: $O(n^2 \log(nC) / \epsilon)$ where $C$ is the cost range.

couplr offers three Auction variants:

| Variant | `method =` | Key Feature |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Standard | `"auction"` | Adaptive ε, queue-based |
| Scaled | `"auction_scaled"` | ε-scaling phases |
| Gauss-Seidel | `"auction_gs"` | Sequential sweep |

```{r auction-example}
set.seed(123)
n <- 800
cost <- matrix(runif(n * n, 0, 100), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "auction"))
```

Auction shines for large dense problems. But it's sensitive to ε. Get it wrong and performance degrades—or the algorithm cycles forever.

The next algorithm makes ε-scaling systematic.

---

### Cost-Scaling Algorithm / CSA (1995)

Andrew Goldberg and Robert Kennedy asked: what if we scale ε automatically?

**The idea**: Start with $\epsilon = \max(c_{ij})$. In each phase, halve ε and refine the current solution. After $O(\log C)$ phases, ε is essentially zero: optimality.

```{r csa-diagram, fig.width=9, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="CSA algorithm showing epsilon-scaling phases converging to optimal solution"}
# CSA visualization: epsilon scaling progression
phases <- data.frame(
  phase = 1:5,
  epsilon = c(100, 50, 25, 12, 6),
  x = 1:5
)

# Gradient of colors from light to dark green
phase_colors <- colorRampPalette(c("#A8D5BA", col_optimal))(5)

ggplot(phases) +
  # Progress bar background

           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"), type = "closed"),
           linewidth = 1, color = "#3E3F3A") +
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = 0.98, label = "ε halves each phase → precision improves",
           size = 3.8, color = "#3E3F3A") +
  labs(title = "CSA: Systematic ε-Scaling",
       subtitle = "Each phase halves ε and refines the assignment until optimal") +
  theme_diagram() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.5, xlim = c(0.3, 5.7), ylim = c(0, 1.15))
```

**Why it's fast**: Each phase is cheap because the previous phase's solution is a good starting point. The algorithm exploits its own progress.

**Complexity**: $O(n^3)$ amortized, often faster in practice.

```{r csa-example}
set.seed(456)
n <- 800
cost <- matrix(runif(n * n, 0, 100), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "csa"))
```

CSA often wins benchmarks for medium-large dense problems. It's the workhorse.

But there's an even stranger approach: what if instead of scaling costs, you scaled *bits*?

### Gabow-Tarjan Algorithm (1989)

Harold Gabow and Robert Tarjan developed one of the most elegant algorithms in combinatorial optimization. It's also one of the most complex to implement.

**The insight**: Integer costs have a natural scale: binary digits. Process costs from most significant to least significant bit. At each scale, solve a simpler problem. Use that solution to warm-start the next scale.

```{r gabow-tarjan-diagram, fig.width=9, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Gabow-Tarjan bit-scaling showing costs processed from high bits to low bits"}
# Bit-scaling visualization - cleaner design
bits <- data.frame(
  bit = 7:0,
  x = 1:8,
  label = c("128", "64", "32", "16", "8", "4", "2", "1"),
  stage = c(rep("done", 4), "current", rep("pending", 3))
)

# Colors for stages
stage_colors <- c("done" = col_optimal, "current" = "#F39C12", "pending" = col_nonopt)

ggplot(bits) +
  # Bit boxes with status coloring
  geom_tile(aes(x = x, y = 0.5, fill = stage),
            width = 0.85, height = 0.7, color = "white", linewidth = 2) +
  # Bit value labels
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = 0.5, label = label),
            fontface = "bold", size = 5, color = "white") +
  # Bit position labels (use #3E3F3A for dark mode compatibility)
  geom_text(aes(x = x, y = 0.02, label = paste0("bit ", 8 - bit)),
            size = 3, color = "#3E3F3A") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stage_colors,
                    labels = c("done" = "Processed", "current" = "Current", "pending" = "Remaining"),
                    name = "") +
  # Direction indicator
  annotate("segment", x = 1, xend = 8, y = 1.05, yend = 1.05,
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"), type = "closed"),
           linewidth = 1.2, color = "#3E3F3A") +
  annotate("text", x = 4.5, y = 1.18, label = "Process most significant → least significant",
           size = 3.8, color = "#3E3F3A") +
  labs(title = "Gabow-Tarjan: Bit-Scaling",
       subtitle = "Process integer costs bit-by-bit from coarse to fine. Complexity: O(n³ log C)") +
  theme_diagram() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10, color = "#3E3F3A")) +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.2, xlim = c(0.3, 8.7), ylim = c(-0.15, 1.35))
```

**The algorithm** (simplified):

1. Initialize at the coarsest scale (most significant bit only).
2. Double the scale: multiply all costs by 2. This "doubles" the current solution's slack.
3. Restore **1-feasibility**: ensure dual prices are almost-optimal.
4. Use Hungarian-style search for augmenting paths.
5. Repeat until all bits are processed.

**Complexity**: $O(n^3 \log C)$ where $C$ is the maximum cost.

Rarely seen outside academic papers. The bookkeeping for 1-feasibility across scaling phases is intricate enough that most implementations skip it.

```{r gabow-tarjan-example}
set.seed(42)
n <- 200
# Use integer costs with large range - Gabow-Tarjan's strength
cost <- matrix(sample(1:100000, n * n, replace = TRUE), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "gabow_tarjan"))
```

Gabow-Tarjan is primarily of theoretical interest—it provides the best known worst-case bounds for integer costs. But there's one more scaling algorithm, with even better theoretical complexity.

---

### Orlin-Ahuja Algorithm (1992)

James Orlin and Ravindra Ahuja developed a **double-scaling** algorithm: scale both costs AND capacities.

**Complexity**: $O(\sqrt{n} \cdot m \cdot \log(nC))$ where $m$ is the number of edges.

For sparse problems, this is sublinear in $n$. Theoretically optimal for many cases.

A textbook algorithm that rarely leaves textbooks. Maintaining blocking flows across scaling phases requires careful data structure engineering.

```{r orlin-example}
set.seed(111)
n <- 200
cost <- matrix(sample(1:100000, n * n, replace = TRUE), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "orlin"))
```

Orlin-Ahuja gives the best theoretical bounds for sparse problems with large cost ranges. In practice, the overhead often makes it slower than CSA for dense problems. But for the right class of problems, it's unbeatable.

That's four scaling algorithms, each trading precision for speed in a different way. But there's a completely different way to think about the problem entirely.

---

## The Network View

Every algorithm so far thinks in terms of assignments: matching workers to jobs. But assignment problems are secretly **flow problems**.

Model the assignment as a network:
- A source node connected to all workers (capacity 1 each)
- Workers connected to jobs (with costs)
- Jobs connected to a sink node (capacity 1 each)
- Find minimum-cost flow of value $n$

This perspective unlocks two more algorithms.

---

### Network Simplex

The simplex method, specialized for networks. Instead of a matrix basis, maintain a **spanning tree**.

```{r network-simplex-diagram, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Network simplex spanning tree structure for assignment problem"}
# Flow network: Source -> Workers -> Jobs -> Sink
nodes <- tibble(
  name = c("S", "W1", "W2", "W3", "J1", "J2", "J3", "T"),
  type = c("Source", rep("Worker", 3), rep("Job", 3), "Sink")
)

# Edges with tree/non-tree status and costs
edges <- tibble(
  from = c(1,1,1, 2,2,3,3,4,4, 5,6,7),
  to =   c(2,3,4, 5,6,6,5,7,6, 8,8,8),
  in_tree = c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE, TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE, TRUE,TRUE,TRUE),
  cost = c(0,0,0, 3,5,2,7,4,6, 0,0,0)
)

g <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = TRUE)

# Layout: Source | Workers | Jobs | Sink
layout <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5),
  y = c(2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2)
)

ggraph(g, layout = "manual", x = layout$x, y = layout$y) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_colour = in_tree, edge_width = in_tree,
                     edge_linetype = in_tree, label = ifelse(cost > 0, cost, NA)),
                 angle_calc = "along", label_dodge = unit(2, "mm"),
                 label_size = 3, fontface = "bold",
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(2.5, "mm"), type = "closed"),
                 end_cap = circle(6, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = type), shape = 21, size = 11, color = "white", stroke = 1.5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Source" = col_text, "Worker" = col_worker,
                               "Job" = col_job, "Sink" = col_text), name = NULL) +
  scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("TRUE" = col_optimal, "FALSE" = col_nonopt),
                           labels = c("Non-tree", "Tree (basis)"), name = "Edge") +
  scale_edge_width_manual(values = c("TRUE" = 1, "FALSE" = 0.5), guide = "none") +
  scale_edge_linetype_manual(values = c("TRUE" = "solid", "FALSE" = "dashed"), guide = "none") +
  labs(title = "Network Simplex: Spanning Tree Basis",
       subtitle = "Pivot operations swap tree edges to improve solution") +
  theme_graph_clean() +
  coord_fixed(clip = "off")
```

**The algorithm**:

1. Start with a spanning tree (any feasible basis).
2. Compute node potentials (dual prices) from the tree.
3. Find a non-tree edge with negative reduced cost.
4. Add it to the tree, creating a cycle. Remove an edge from the cycle.
5. Repeat until no improving edges exist.

**Complexity**: $O(n^3)$ typical, polynomial worst-case.

**When it shines**: When you need dual variable information. When you're already working with network flows.

```{r network-simplex-example}
set.seed(789)
n <- 300
cost <- matrix(runif(n * n, 0, 100), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "network_simplex"))
```

Network Simplex is a workhorse of operations research. It's not always the fastest, but it's reliable and provides rich dual information.

### Push-Relabel Algorithm

Goldberg and Tarjan's push-relabel algorithm, adapted for minimum-cost flow.

**The key difference**: Allow *preflow*—temporary excess at intermediate nodes. Instead of finding augmenting paths globally, push flow locally and relabel nodes to make pushing possible.

```{r push-relabel-diagram, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Push-relabel algorithm showing excess accumulating at nodes and discharge operations"}
# Simplified flow network
nodes <- tibble(
  name = c("S", "W1", "W2", "J1", "J2", "T"),
  excess = c(0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0),
  height = c(4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 0),
  has_excess = excess > 0
)

edges <- tibble(
  from = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5),
  to = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6),
  edge_type = factor(c("Flow", "Flow", "Push", "Available", "Flow", "Flow"),
                     levels = c("Push", "Flow", "Available"))
)

g <- tbl_graph(nodes = nodes, edges = edges, directed = TRUE)

layout <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 1.5, 1.5, 3.5, 3.5, 5),
  y = c(1.5, 2.5, 0.5, 2.5, 0.5, 1.5)
)

ggraph(g, layout = "manual", x = layout$x, y = layout$y) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_colour = edge_type, edge_width = edge_type),
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(3, "mm"), type = "closed"),
                 end_cap = circle(7, "mm")) +
  geom_node_point(aes(fill = has_excess), shape = 21, size = 12,
                  color = "white", stroke = 1.5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = paste0(name, "\nh=", height)),
                 color = "white", fontface = "bold", size = 3.2, lineheight = 0.85) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("FALSE" = col_job, "TRUE" = "#F39C12"),
                    labels = c("No excess", "Has excess"), name = "Node") +
  scale_edge_colour_manual(values = c("Push" = col_highlight, "Flow" = col_nonopt,
                                      "Available" = col_nonopt), name = "Edge") +
  scale_edge_width_manual(values = c("Push" = 1.5, "Flow" = 0.8, "Available" = 0.8),
                          guide = "none") +
  labs(title = "Push-Relabel: Local Operations",
       subtitle = "Push excess to lower-height neighbors; relabel when stuck") +
  theme_graph_clean() +
  coord_fixed(clip = "off")
```

**The algorithm**:

1. Initialize with maximum flow from source (creates excess at workers).
2. While any node has excess:
   - **Push**: Send flow to a lower-height neighbor.
   - **Relabel**: If no lower neighbor, increase height.
3. Excess eventually drains to the sink.

**Complexity**: $O(n^2 m)$ worst-case.

**When it shines**: Parallelizable (pushes are local). Good for max-flow style problems.

```{r push-relabel-example}
set.seed(222)
n <- 300
cost <- matrix(runif(n * n, 0, 100), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "push_relabel"))
```

Two network perspectives. Same problem. Different algorithmic approaches.

But all these algorithms assume dense, square matrices. Real problems are messier.

## The Specialists

### HK01: Binary Costs

When costs are only 0 or 1, we don't need the full machinery.

**The algorithm**: Hopcroft-Karp for maximum cardinality matching, run on zero-cost edges first. Then add 1-cost edges as needed.

**Complexity**: $O(n^{2.5})$ for binary costs.

```{r hk01-example}
set.seed(101)
n <- 500
cost <- matrix(sample(0:1, n^2, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.7)), n, n)
system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "hk01"))
```

When you have binary costs and large $n$, HK01 is dramatically faster.

---

### SAP and LAPMOD: Sparse Problems

When 80% of entries are forbidden (Inf or NA), why store them?

**SAP** (Shortest Augmenting Path) and **LAPMOD** use sparse representations: adjacency lists instead of dense matrices.

**Complexity**: $O(n^2 + nm)$ where $m$ is the number of allowed edges.

```{r sap-example}
set.seed(789)
n <- 500
cost <- matrix(Inf, n, n)
edges <- sample(1:(n^2), floor(0.2 * n^2))  # Only 20% allowed
cost[edges] <- runif(length(edges), 0, 100)

system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "sap"))
```

For very sparse problems, SAP can be orders of magnitude faster than dense algorithms.

---

### Ramshaw-Tarjan: Rectangular Problems (2012)

Most algorithms assume square matrices. When $n \neq m$, they pad with dummy rows/columns.

Ramshaw and Tarjan (2012) developed an algorithm that handles rectangularity natively.

The newest algorithm here. Published in 2012, it handles the rectangular case without padding tricks.

```{r ramshaw-tarjan-example}
set.seed(333)
n_rows <- 100
n_cols <- 500  # Highly rectangular
cost <- matrix(runif(n_rows * n_cols, 0, 100), n_rows, n_cols)

system.time(result <- lap_solve(cost, method = "ramshaw_tarjan"))
cat("Matched", sum(result$assignment > 0), "of", n_rows, "rows\n")
```

When you have significantly more columns than rows (or vice versa), Ramshaw-Tarjan avoids wasted work on padding.

---

## Beyond Standard Assignment

couplr includes specialized solvers for variations on the assignment problem.

### K-Best Solutions (Murty's Algorithm)

What if you want not just the best assignment, but the 2nd best, 3rd best, ..., k-th best?

```{r murty-example}
cost <- matrix(c(10, 19, 8, 15, 10, 18, 7, 17, 13, 16, 9, 14, 12, 19, 8, 18),
               nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
kbest <- lap_solve_kbest(cost, k = 5)
summary(kbest)
```

**Use cases**: Robustness analysis. Alternative plans when the optimal is infeasible. Understanding the cost landscape.

### Bottleneck Assignment

Minimize the **maximum** edge cost instead of the sum.

```{r bottleneck-example}
cost <- matrix(c(5, 9, 2, 10, 3, 7, 8, 4, 6), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
result <- bottleneck_assignment(cost)
cat("Bottleneck (max edge):", result$bottleneck, "\n")
```

**Use cases**: Load balancing. Fairness constraints. Worst-case optimization.

### Sinkhorn: Soft Assignment

Entropy-regularized optimal transport. Instead of hard 0/1 assignment, produce a doubly-stochastic transport plan.

```{r sinkhorn-example}
cost <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2)
result <- sinkhorn(cost, lambda = 10)
print(round(result$transport_plan, 3))
```

**Use cases**: Probabilistic matching. Domain adaptation. Wasserstein distances.

### Dual Variables

Extract dual prices for sensitivity analysis.

```{r duals-example}
cost <- matrix(c(10, 19, 8, 15, 10, 18, 7, 17, 13), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
result <- assignment_duals(cost)
cat("Row duals (u):", result$u, "\n")
cat("Col duals (v):", result$v, "\n")
```

**Use cases**: Shadow prices. Identifying critical assignments. Marginal cost analysis.

---

## The Benchmark

You've seen what the algorithms do. Now: how fast?

```{r benchmark-plot, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Runtime comparison of LAP algorithms across problem sizes showing CSA and JV leading"}
bench_results <- data.frame(

  )
)

    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, colour = "#3E3F3A"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

**For dense matrices**: CSA and JV are consistently fastest. Hungarian falls behind rapidly. Auction and Network Simplex are solid middle-ground choices.

```{r sparse-plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.alt="Sparse algorithm performance showing SAP and LAPMOD outperforming dense algorithms"}

  )
```

**For sparse matrices**: SAP and LAPMOD are 10× faster than dense algorithms. Use them.
