# Automatic solver dispatch
# ==============================================================================
# One rule table, read by assignment() to pick a solver and by
# explain_dispatch() to report why. Adding a rule is a list entry, not an edit
# to a branch chain that then has to be mirrored in the documentation.
# ==============================================================================

# Ordered; the first rule whose `test` holds wins. `condition` names the
# triggering property in the same terms as ?assignment, and `reason` states why
# that property favours the method.

#' Explain which solver `method = "auto"` selects, and why
#'
#' `assignment(method = "auto")` picks a solver from a small set of rules
#' evaluated against one pass over the cost matrix. This reports the decision
#' without solving: which rule fired, the property that triggered it, the rules
#' that were tested first and did not fire, and the internal representation the
#' problem will be handed to the solver in.
#'
#' The same rule table drives the dispatch itself, so the report cannot drift
#' from the behaviour.
#'
#' @param cost Numeric matrix, as passed to [assignment()]. `NA` or `Inf`
#'   entries are treated as forbidden.
#' @param method Character scalar. `"auto"` (default) reports the automatic
#'   decision. Naming any other method reports that the choice was explicit and
#'   which rule `"auto"` would have picked instead.
#' @param maximize,cardinality,n_matches,unmatched_penalty As in [assignment()].
#'   A cardinality other than `"complete"` appends dummy columns before the
#'   solver sees the problem, which changes its shape and sparsity, so the rules
#'   are evaluated against the same matrix `assignment()` would hand the solver.
#'
#' @return An object of class `dispatch_explanation`, a list with elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `method` - the solver that will run.
#'   \item `explicit` - `TRUE` when `method` was named rather than dispatched.
#'   \item `rule`, `condition`, `reason` - the rule that fired under `"auto"`.
#'   \item `considered` - data frame of every rule tested, in order, with
#'         whether it fired.
#'   \item `n`, `m`, `transposed` - problem shape, and whether the solver sees
#'         the transpose. Rectangular problems are transposed internally so the
#'         solver always has at least as many columns as rows.
#'   \item `probe` - the single-pass summary the rules read.
