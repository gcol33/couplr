// src/flow/flow_implicit.h
// The outer loop: an assignment over a complete implicit graph, solved by
// generating the pairs it turns out to need.
// Pure C++ - NO Rcpp dependencies, same rule as lap_types.h.
//
// The problem is stated over every pair of a cost source and solved over a
// fraction of them. Seven steps:
//
//   1. Give every row some admissible columns to start from.
//   2. Solve that restricted master.
//   3. Read its potentials as assignment duals u, v, on the tight face the
//      assignment LP asks for rather than the one min-cost flow settles for.
//   4. Price the pairs the master does not hold: cbar_ij = c_ij - u_i - v_j.
//   5. Add the pairs that price below -tol, and only those.
//   6. Warm start from the incumbent flow and re-solve.
//   7. Repeat until nothing prices below -tol.
//
// At that point the duals are feasible for every pair of the complete implicit
// problem and the restricted answer is optimal for it. That is what separates
// this from approximate k-nearest matching, which solves the same restricted
// master and stops at step 2.
//
// The loop lives in C++ because it owns the FlowProblem, the candidate set and
// the cost source, none of which have an R representation, and because it
// crosses to R once rather than once per round.
//
// **Feasibility is a different question and gets a different phase.** A master
// that comes back short of the required flow has no dual solution to price
// with, so a round that falls short hands over to flow_feasibility.h: Hall's
// witness names the rows that could not be matched and the re-seed aims at the
// columns that can repair them, or reports that no arc set over this source
// admits a complete matching and says why.
//
// The assignment -- one block, every row carrying one unit, every column at
// most one -- is the design Hall's condition answers feasibility for and the LP
// lap_certify.h certifies, and solve_implicit_assignment() runs it. Any other
// design compiled onto one block of pair arcs runs the same rounds through
// solve_implicit_design(), which prices against the flow's own potentials and
// answers a shortfall with a maximum-flow cut; see the section above it.

// Columns the seed gives a deficient row when the caller names no width.
//
// The loop's floor is two rounds: one to seed, one to sweep the omitted pairs,
// find nothing that prices in, and certify. It reaches that floor once the seed
// already holds every pair that can end up tight, and a seed short of it buys
// its missing pairs a round at a time, each round costing a further sweep and a
// further master solve.
//
// Where that floor is reached is not readable off the shape of the problem.
// Over ncol from 3.3e3 to 6.7e4 it ran from 20 columns to 230, and the data
// moved it further than the size did: eight-dimensional Gaussian coordinates
// reached it at 21, 20, 32 and 68 columns across those sizes, while the same
// sizes over six Gaussian coordinates and two binary ones needed 20, 40, 40 and
// 80 -- covariates that tie leave many columns at one distance from a row, and
// a row then has to hold more of them. Nothing the loop can read before it
// seeds separates those cases.
//
// So the seed is sized to clear the floor rather than to sit on it, which is
// the cheap side to miss on wherever a sweep is expensive. Six columns per
// doubling of ncol clears every measured case whose pairs the ball bound cannot
// prune, and costs 2% to 21% over the width that reached the floor exactly; the
// seeds below the floor ran 30% to 150% over. A source with fewer columns than
// the rule asks for takes all of them.
//
// The exception runs the other way and is left alone deliberately. Where the
// bound does prune -- two coordinates, a few percent of the grid evaluated --
// a further sweep is cheap and a wider seed is not, so the fastest run sits
// below the floor rather than on it: at ncol = 6.7e4 the floor wanted 230
// columns and took 5.33 s, where 45 columns took 2.66 s over five rounds. The
// rule asks for 102 there and lands at 3.53 s. It is deliberately short of that

//
// A compiled design other than the assignment -- a full matching, a ratio, a
// variable ratio -- is the same three-layer network with other bounds on the
// source and sink arcs, and its pair arcs are still [0, 1] over one cost source.
// Two things change, and neither is the pricing.
//
// The duals are the potentials themselves. An arc from row node r to column node
// c reduces to cost + pi(r) - pi(c), which is the pricer's c - u_i - v_j with
// u_i = -pi(row_i) and v_j = pi(col_j). A pair the master omits sits at its
// lower bound of zero, so the complete problem is optimal exactly when no
// omitted pair prices below zero against the master's potentials: every arc
// the master holds already satisfies its own slackness, and the omitted ones
// are the only arcs left to ask.
//
// Feasibility is a maximum flow rather than a matching of every row. A master
// short of its flow leaves some nodes with excess, and the nodes it can still
// reach in the residual graph form a set R holding no deficit node, since a
// deficit inside R would be an augmenting path. An omitted pair could raise the
// flow only by leaving R: a row inside it and a column outside. So a round asks
// for exactly those pairs, the cheapest `width` per row inside R, or per column
// outside it when that side is the smaller, and when there are none the flow the
// master placed is the maximum over every arc the source admits, not only over
// the ones it holds. The master's potentials leave every residual arc priced at
// or above zero, and the solver settles a shortfall as the cheapest flow of its
// value, so pricing the omitted pairs then decides the cost of that maximum
// flow the way it decides the cost of a complete one.
