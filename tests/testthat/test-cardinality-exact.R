# ==============================================================================
# Balance-constrained cardinality matching
# ==============================================================================
# Three claims are checked here, and they are checked against statements of the
# problem that never touch the search.
#
#   The network solves. .flow_solve() returns an integral flow on the balance
#   network, verify_flow() certifies it, the certificate fails when a potential
#   is moved, and the solved flow reaches the same objective as the cheapest
#   encoding of any matched set.
#
#   The answer is the answer. Over every partial injection of a tiny instance,
#   the matched set the driver returns has the enumerated optimum's objective,
#   its cardinality and its imbalance at every level, and with moment
#   constraints in place the pairs it returns satisfy every row recomputed from
#   the coefficients.
#
#   The gap is never a claim nobody checked. Interrupted at a node limit, at a
#   time limit, or by a predicate, the driver returns a matched set that
#   satisfies every stated constraint, a gap above zero, and no certificate.
