// src/flow/flow_compile.h
// One compiler per matching design: the design goes in as a cost source plus
// its parameters, a FlowProblem comes out together with the index metadata a
// caller needs to read a solved flow back out in its own terms.
//
// Every design is the same three-layer network and differs only in the bounds
// on its three arc sets:
//
//     source --[row bounds]--> row --[0..1 per pair]--> column --[column
//     capacity]--> sink
//
// so the compilers share one builder and each one is the bounds it chooses:
//
//   design           row throughput            column capacity   flow value
//   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   1:1              supply 1 per row node     1                 n_rows
//   k:1 fixed ratio  supply 1 per row node,    1                 k * n_rows
//                    rows replicated k times
//   replacement      supply k per row node     n_rows            k * n_rows
//   variable ratio   source arc [r_min,r_max]  1                 min(n_rows *
//                                                                r_max, n_cols)
//   k-cardinality    source arc [0, 1]         1                 k
//   full matching    source arc [c_min,c_max]  1                 n_units
//   exact / blocked  supply 1 per row node,    1                 n_rows
//                    one block per stratum
//
// A design whose row throughput is a range, or whose flow value is smaller than
// what the rows could carry, needs the auxiliary source to hold the slack; a
// design whose rows each carry a fixed amount puts that amount on the row node
// and leaves the source unused. The distinction is what the lowering predicate
// at the bottom of this file reads.
//
// Node layout is flow_problem.h's, unchanged:
//
//     0                        auxiliary source
//     1                        auxiliary sink
//     2 .. 2+nr-1              row nodes
//     2+nr .. 2+nr+nc-1        column nodes
//     2+nr+nc ..               category nodes (section F), stratum nodes
//
// Lower bounds are emitted as lower bounds. The transformation that turns them
// into supplies and auxiliary arcs belongs to the solver, so a compiler here
// states what the design means and never what a residual graph needs.
